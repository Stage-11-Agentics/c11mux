"""C11-26 regression: surface.send_text never blocks the main queue.

Why this test exists
--------------------
A captured 2026-05-03 hang showed `v2SurfaceSendText` parked in a nested
`CFRunLoopRun` inside an outer `DispatchQueue.main.sync` block: the handler
wrapped its body in `v2MainSync` and then called `waitForTerminalSurface`
(→ `v2AwaitCallback`), whose main-thread branch schedules its timeout via
`DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`. Because the main queue was already serialising
the outer block, the timeout block could never be popped — the wait was
unbounded. Sample evidence: 7120/7120 of a 10-second window stuck in the same
stack.

C11-26 routes `surface.send_text` (and the rest of the v2MainSync-wrapping
surface.* family) onto the socket worker thread via
`SocketCommandExecutionPolicy.socketWorker`. On the worker thread,
`v2AwaitCallback` takes its semaphore branch instead of `CFRunLoopRun`, and
the wait is bounded.

What this test asserts
----------------------
- `surface.send_text` returns within a generous wall-clock budget even while
  the main actor is being kept busy by other socket calls. Pre-fix, this could
  hang indefinitely; post-fix, the worker-side semaphore wait completes within
  the handler's 2.0 s internal timeout plus normal scheduling overhead.
- 20 parallel `surface.send_text` calls all complete within the wall-clock
  budget, exercising the off-main routing under concurrent load.

What this test does NOT do
--------------------------
- It does not grep `Sources/TerminalController.swift` for `nonisolated` or
  `SocketCommandExecutionPolicy` (per c11 CLAUDE.md "Test quality policy" —
  tests verify observable runtime behavior, not implementation shape).
- It does not directly reproduce the not-yet-attached precondition without a
  `workspace.apply` primitive (CMUX-37 territory). The single-call scenario
  uses parallel main-actor pressure to stress the same dispatch path; the
  burst scenario broadens coverage. If a future operator wants the
  not-yet-attached repro, they can extend the test once the workspace.apply
  primitive lands.

How to run
----------
This test runs against a tagged debug build of c11. Per c11 CLAUDE.md
"Testing policy", do NOT `open` an untagged `c11 DEV.app` to run this test —
use the tagged build socket the delegator produced via
`./scripts/reload.sh --tag <ticket-slug>`.
