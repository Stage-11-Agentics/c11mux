# c11 agent notes

## Mission

c11 is a macOS command center for the operator:agent pair. Terminals, browsers, and markdown surfaces composed in one window — addressable, scriptable, held in one field of view while many agents work in parallel. It embeds Ghostty as the terminal engine and treats the workspace itself as the atom of work.

Short name: **c11**. Formal long name (publicly): **c11 terminal multiplexer**. Use the short form in CLI, UI, filenames, and default prose; reach for the long form for first references in formal external contexts (press, docs landing pages, legal copy).

Theme naming: in user-facing product copy, say **c11 theme** and **Light/Dark theme slots**; reserve **chrome theme** for internal code/socket disambiguation from Ghostty terminal themes.

**Who it's for.** The operator running eight, ten, thirty agents at once. The one already feeling the pain of `cmd-tab` roulette across a screen full of terminal windows and wanting structure — not less work, just enough shape that the whole orchestra stays legible while the agents drive.

**What that implies for this codebase.** Every surface has a handle. Every handle is scriptable from outside the process. Agents are first-class; the CLI and socket exist so they can compose their own environment without the operator in the loop for routine moves.

## Lineage

tmux → [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) → c11. tmux was for humans driving shells. cmux by [manaflow-ai](https://github.com/manaflow-ai) is the parent — the Ghostty embed, the browser substrate, and the CLI shape all belong to them upstream. c11 is the fork-level iteration for the operator:agent pair: more primitives (markdown surfaces, addressable surface handles, the skill system, agent-written sidebar telemetry), same ancestry. The tab bar and split chrome come from [Bonsplit](https://github.com/almonk/bonsplit) by [almonk](https://github.com/almonk), forked in `vendor/bonsplit/`.

### The cmux ↔ c11 relationship is bidirectional

Both projects are open source. The relationship between them is unusual and worth making explicit so nobody has to guess:

- **Upstream → c11 (pull).** We may cherry-pick or merge PRs and commits from `manaflow-ai/cmux` when they fix bugs, improve performance, or add primitives we want. Credit stays with the original authors in the commit metadata. Don't rewrite their code to look like ours; import it cleanly so the provenance is obvious and future syncs stay clean.
- **c11 → upstream (suggest).** When a fix or improvement made in c11 would also benefit cmux — a bug fix in a shared code path, a performance win in Ghostty embedding, a CLI ergonomics improvement that isn't c11-specific — surface it. Options: open a PR against `manaflow-ai/cmux` directly, or flag it to the operator with a one-line note so they can decide. Default to offering the fix upstream; c11-specific work (skill system, agent telemetry, markdown surfaces, operator-centric primitives) stays here.
- **What stays c11-only.** Anything that only makes sense under "the operator:agent pair is the unit" framing. Agent-facing primitives, skill infrastructure, sidebar telemetry written by agents, the c11 brand surface. These are fork-level by design.

**Practical implication for agents working in this repo:** when you touch a file that clearly came from upstream and your fix isn't c11-specific, flag it. The operator can decide whether to land it here, upstream, or both. Don't silently diverge on shared code — it makes future upstream merges painful and costs both projects improvements they'd otherwise share.

Treat upstream patterns as load-bearing unless you have a specific reason to diverge. Gratuitous divergence burns goodwill and future merge bandwidth.

## The skill is the agent's steering wheel

c11's value to an agent is **the skill** — `skills/c11/SKILL.md` plus the peer skills (`c11-browser`, `c11-markdown`, `c11-debug-windows`, `c11-hotload`, `release`). An agent that's read the skill learns to split panes, open markdown surfaces, drive the embedded browser, report status to the sidebar, and navigate the workspace as infrastructure. An agent that hasn't just sees another terminal.

**The bar: fast, fluid, effective.** An agent should be able to fully drive a c11 session — spawning the surfaces it needs, dissolving them when done, reporting progress, recovering from its own mistakes — without the operator having to intervene for routine moves. That only happens if the skill teaches it how, accurately, tersely, and in the exact shape of the CLI that ships.

**Therefore:** every change to the CLI, socket protocol, metadata schema, or surface model is incomplete until the skill is updated to match. If you add a command, add it to the skill. If you rename a command, rename it in the skill. If you change defaults, update the examples. The skill is the contract; let it rot and agents get worse at using c11. Invest there first, not last.

## Principle: unopinionated about the terminal

c11 is **host and primitive, not configurator.** It provides surfaces, panes, a socket, a CLI, and a metadata seam — all scoped to c11's own runtime. It does not reach outside that boundary to install hooks, write to tenant config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/*`, `~/.kimi/*`, shell rc files, etc.), or inject behavior into any other TUI's launch path. The one outgoing touch is the c11 skill file, which agents opt into by reading it.

Consequences:

- **`c11 install <tui>` is rejected.** Any proposal that writes to a user's persistent tool config is a non-starter, even with consent prompts and markers. The 691-line spec at `docs/c11mux-module-4-integration-installers-spec.md` exists as a historical artifact only — do not revive it.
- **`Resources/bin/claude` is a grandfathered cc-specific exception**, not a pattern to extend. PATH-scoped, no persistent writes anywhere. The wrapper's header carries a `DO NOT GENERALIZE` note. Do not build equivalent wrappers for codex, kimi, opencode, or any future TUI.
- **Skill-driven self-reporting is the standard pattern** for every agent except cc. Agents that read the c11 skill learn to call `c11 set-metadata` / `c11 set-status` from their own lifecycle. The `cmux` CLI is a compat alias that dispatches to the same binary. Agents that ignore the skill don't emit — that's the expected and correct outcome under the principle.
- **The skill file is the only outgoing touch.** How it reaches each TUI (cc's `~/.claude/skills/`, codex's equivalent, etc.) is the operator's problem, not c11's.

When in doubt: c11's job stops at the edge of its surfaces. What happens inside an agent's process is the agent's business.

## Local dev

See `skills/c11-hotload/SKILL.md` for the full workflow — `reload.sh --tag` build-and-launch, Release variants, the debug event log, tag hygiene, and the tagged-build reporting format.

The one-liner: after any code change, `./scripts/reload.sh --tag <your-branch-slug>`. Never `open` an untagged `c11 DEV.app`.

## Pitfalls

- **Custom UTTypes** for drag-and-drop must be declared in `Resources/Info.plist` under `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` (e.g. `com.stage11.c11.tabtransfer`, `com.stage11.c11.sidebar-tab-reorder`).
- Do not add an app-level display link or manual `ghostty_surface_draw` loop; rely on Ghostty wakeups/renderer to avoid typing lag.
- **Typing-latency-sensitive paths** (read carefully before touching these areas):
  - `WindowTerminalHostView.hitTest()` in `TerminalWindowPortal.swift`: called on every event including keyboard. All divider/sidebar/drag routing is gated to pointer events only. Do not add work outside the `isPointerEvent` guard.
  - `TabItemView` in `ContentView.swift`: uses `Equatable` conformance + `.equatable()` to skip body re-evaluation during typing. Do not add `@EnvironmentObject`, `@ObservedObject` (besides `tab`), or `@Binding` properties without updating the `==` function. Do not remove `.equatable()` from the ForEach call site. Do not read `tabManager` or `notificationStore` in the body; use the precomputed `let` parameters instead.
  - `TerminalSurface.forceRefresh()` in `GhosttyTerminalView.swift`: called on every keystroke. Do not add allocations, file I/O, or formatting here.
- **Terminal find layering contract:** `SurfaceSearchOverlay` must be mounted from `GhosttySurfaceScrollView` in `Sources/GhosttyTerminalView.swift` (AppKit portal layer), not from SwiftUI panel containers such as `Sources/Panels/TerminalPanelView.swift`. Portal-hosted terminal views can sit above SwiftUI during split/workspace churn.
- **Submodule safety:** When modifying a submodule (ghostty, vendor/bonsplit, etc.), always push the submodule commit to its remote `main` branch BEFORE committing the updated pointer in the parent repo. Never commit on a detached HEAD or temporary branch — the commit will be orphaned and lost. Verify with: `cd <submodule> && git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/main`.
- **All user-facing strings must be localized.** Use `String(localized: "key.name", defaultValue: "English text")` for every string shown in the UI (labels, buttons, menus, dialogs, tooltips, error messages). Keys go in `Resources/Localizable.xcstrings` with translations for all supported languages (currently English and Japanese). Never use bare string literals in SwiftUI `Text()`, `Button()`, alert titles, etc.

## Test quality policy

- Do not add tests that only verify source code text, method signatures, AST fragments, or grep-style patterns.
- Do not add tests that read checked-in metadata or project files such as `Resources/Info.plist`, `project.pbxproj`, `.xcconfig`, or source files only to assert that a key, string, plist entry, or snippet exists.
- Tests must verify observable runtime behavior through executable paths (unit/integration/e2e/CLI), not implementation shape.
- For metadata changes, prefer verifying the built app bundle or the runtime behavior that depends on that metadata, not the checked-in source file.
- If a behavior cannot be exercised end-to-end yet, add a small runtime seam or harness first, then test through that seam.
- If no meaningful behavioral or artifact-level test is practical, skip the fake regression test and state that explicitly.

## Testing policy

**Never run tests locally.** All tests (E2E, UI, python socket tests) run via GitHub Actions or on the VM.

- **E2E / UI tests:** trigger via `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml` (see cmuxterm-hq CLAUDE.md for details)
- **Unit tests:** `xcodebuild -scheme c11-unit` is safe (no app launch), but prefer CI
- **Python socket tests (tests_v2/):** these connect to a running c11 instance's socket. Never launch an untagged `c11 DEV.app` to run them. If you must test locally, use a tagged build's socket (`/tmp/c11-debug-<tag>.sock`) with `C11_SOCKET=/tmp/c11-debug-<tag>.sock` (or `CMUX_SOCKET=…` as compat).
- **Never `open` an untagged `c11 DEV.app`** from DerivedData. It conflicts with the user's running debug instance.

## Socket command threading policy

- Do not use `DispatchQueue.main.sync` for high-frequency socket telemetry commands (`report_*`, `ports_kick`, status/progress/log metadata updates).
- For telemetry hot paths:
  - Parse and validate arguments off-main.
  - Dedupe/coalesce off-main first.
  - Schedule minimal UI/model mutation with `DispatchQueue.main.async` only when needed.
- Commands that directly manipulate AppKit/Ghostty UI state (focus/select/open/close/send key/input, list/current queries requiring exact synchronous snapshot) are allowed to run on main actor.
- If adding a new socket command, default to off-main handling; require an explicit reason in code comments when main-thread execution is necessary.

## Socket focus policy

- Socket/CLI commands must not steal macOS app focus (no app activation/window raising side effects).
- Only explicit focus-intent commands may mutate in-app focus/selection (`window.focus`, `workspace.select/next/previous/last`, `surface.focus`, `pane.focus/last`, browser focus commands, and v1 focus equivalents).
- All non-focus commands should preserve current user focus context while still applying data/model changes.

## Ghostty submodule workflow

Ghostty changes must be committed in the `ghostty` submodule and pushed to the `manaflow-ai/ghostty` fork. Keep `docs/ghostty-fork.md` up to date with any fork changes and conflict notes.

```bash
cd ghostty
git remote -v  # origin = upstream, manaflow = fork
git checkout -b <branch>
git add <files>
git commit -m "..."
git push manaflow <branch>
```

To keep the fork up to date with upstream:

```bash
cd ghostty
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git merge origin/main
git push manaflow main
```

Then update the parent repo with the new submodule SHA:

```bash
cd ..
git add ghostty
git commit -m "Update ghostty submodule"
```

## Release

See `skills/release/SKILL.md`. Invoke with `/release`.
