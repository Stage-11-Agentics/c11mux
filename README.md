## Fork notice

**c11mux is a Stage 11 Agentics fork of [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) by [manaflow-ai](https://github.com/manaflow-ai).** All credit for the underlying terminal, browser, notification, and CLI work belongs to the upstream authors. This fork exists so Stage 11 can ship its own distribution, experiment with agent-orchestration features that don't fit upstream's direction, and iterate on changes that may or may not land back in cmux.

What changes in the fork: app display name (**c11mux**), bundle ID (`com.stage11.c11mux`), release artifacts, Homebrew tap, and the Sparkle auto-update feed. What stays identical to upstream: the `cmux` CLI binary name, every `CMUX_*` environment variable, socket paths and protocol, shell integration scripts, and all CLI subcommands — so existing scripts, dotfiles, and third-party tools keep working unchanged.

- **Scriptable** — CLI and socket API to create workspaces, split panes, send keystrokes, and automate the browser
- **Native macOS app** — Built with Swift and AppKit, not Electron. Fast startup, low memory.
- **Ghostty compatible** — Reads your existing `~/.config/ghostty/config` for themes, fonts, and colors
- **GPU-accelerated** — Powered by libghostty for smooth rendering

## Install

### DMG (recommended)

<a href="https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/releases/latest/download/c11mux-macos.dmg">
  <img src="./docs/assets/macos-badge.png" alt="Download c11mux for macOS" width="180" />
</a>

Open the `.dmg` and drag c11mux to your Applications folder. c11mux auto-updates via Sparkle, so you only need to download once.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap stage-11-agentics/c11mux
brew install --cask c11mux
```

To update later:

```bash
brew upgrade --cask c11mux
```

The c11mux cask conflicts with the upstream `cmux` cask — installing one will ask you to remove the other. On first launch, macOS may ask you to confirm opening an app from an identified developer. Click **Open** to proceed.

## Why cmux?

_The following section is from the upstream cmux README and describes the original motivation for the project. c11mux inherits all of it._

I run a lot of Claude Code and Codex sessions in parallel. I was using Ghostty with a bunch of split panes, and relying on native macOS notifications to know when an agent needed me. But Claude Code's notification body is always just "Claude is waiting for your input" with no context, and with enough tabs open I couldn't even read the titles anymore.

I tried a few coding orchestrators but most of them were Electron/Tauri apps and the performance bugged me. I also just prefer the terminal since GUI orchestrators lock you into their workflow. So I built cmux as a native macOS app in Swift/AppKit. It uses libghostty for terminal rendering and reads your existing Ghostty config for themes, fonts, and colors.

The main additions are the sidebar and notification system. The sidebar has vertical tabs that show git branch, linked PR status/number, working directory, listening ports, and the latest notification text for each workspace. The notification system picks up terminal sequences (OSC 9/99/777) and has a CLI (`cmux notify`) you can wire into agent hooks for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc. When an agent is waiting, its pane gets a blue ring and the tab lights up in the sidebar, so I can tell which one needs me across splits and tabs. Cmd+Shift+U jumps to the most recent unread.

The in-app browser has a scriptable API ported from [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser). Agents can snapshot the accessibility tree, get element refs, click, fill forms, and evaluate JS. You can split a browser pane next to your terminal and have Claude Code interact with your dev server directly.

Everything is scriptable through the CLI and socket API — create workspaces/tabs, split panes, send keystrokes, open URLs in the browser.

## The Zen of cmux

cmux is not prescriptive about how developers hold their tools. It's a terminal and browser with a CLI, and the rest is up to you.

cmux is a primitive, not a solution. It gives you a terminal, a browser, notifications, workspaces, splits, tabs, and a CLI to control all of it. cmux doesn't force you into an opinionated way to use coding agents. What you build with the primitives is yours.

The best developers have always built their own tools. Nobody has figured out the best way to work with agents yet, and the teams building closed products definitely haven't either. The developers closest to their own codebases will figure it out first.

Give a million developers composable primitives and they'll collectively find the most efficient workflows faster than any product team could design top-down.

## Nightly Builds

[Download c11mux NIGHTLY](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/releases/download/nightly/c11mux-nightly-macos.dmg)

c11mux NIGHTLY is a separate app with its own bundle ID, so it runs alongside the stable version. Built automatically from the latest `main` commit and auto-updates via its own Sparkle feed.

Report nightly bugs on [Stage 11's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/issues). Nightly feedback that applies to behavior inherited from upstream is also welcome on [manaflow-ai/cmux issues](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/issues).

## Session restore (current behavior)

On relaunch, c11mux currently restores app layout and metadata only:
- Window/workspace/pane layout
- Working directories
- Terminal scrollback (best effort)
- Browser URL and navigation history

c11mux does **not** restore live process state inside terminal apps. For example, active Claude Code/tmux/vim sessions are not resumed after restart yet.

## Star History (upstream)

The chart below tracks stars on the upstream [manaflow-ai/cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) repository, which c11mux is derived from.
