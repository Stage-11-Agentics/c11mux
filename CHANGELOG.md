# Changelog

All notable changes to c11 (and, before the fork, cmux) are documented here.

Note: historical entries below pre-date the `c11mux` → `c11` rename and reference the old binary / cask / artifact / bundle-ID names (`cmux`, `c11mux`, `c11mux-macos.dmg`, `stage-11-agentics/c11mux`, `com.stage11.c11mux`). Those entries are preserved as-is for historical accuracy; see the 0.38.0 section for the rename.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Settings sidebar is reorganized into logical pages with a two-column layout, and the Settings window title reads "c11 Settings". — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

### Changed
- User-facing copy tightened across the app — 72 strings rewritten for density and active voice across agent onboarding, confirmation dialogs, the notifications empty state, the Sparkle update flow, the sidebar feedback form, and the browser import wizard. Non-English translations for touched strings are marked `needs_review` for the next translation pass. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- About box tagline now reads *"terminal command center for the operator:agent pair. / many surfaces. one workspace. one field of view."* (replacing the previous architecture description). — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Agent Skills onboarding dialog: "Agentically use c11" / "Skillify Your Agent" becomes "Teach your agent c11" / "Teach My Agent". Body copy, transparency note, and empty-detection state rewritten for clarity. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- User-facing copy normalized from "panel" to "pane" throughout dialogs, menus, and command labels ("Flash Focused Pane", "Reopen Closed Browser Pane", "close the workspace and all of its panes"), matching README and skill vocabulary. Internal Swift type names are unchanged. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Sparkle update flow copy: "Please" filler dropped from error messages, "Update Feed" jargon replaced with "Update Source" / "Update List", and vague error titles rewritten ("App Location Issue" → "c11 isn't in Applications", "Updater Permission Error" → "c11 needs to live in Applications", "Update Signature Error" → "Signature Didn't Verify"). — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- The c11-markdown skill now teaches agents to consolidate multi-artifact sessions into one pane or one file rather than scattering top-level tabs. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

### Fixed
- Settings pages keep their scroll position when switching between sections. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Settings two-column layout rendering. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Settings sidebar review findings addressed. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

## [0.39.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Settings now exposes separate Light and Dark c11 theme slots, each with its own preview and picker. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Agent Skills onboarding now detects existing c11 skills, defaults detected agents into the install/update flow, handles shared skill folders safely, offers Finder reveal for exact skill files, and uses a clearer "Skillify Your Agent" flow. ([#46](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/46)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

### Changed
- Workspace sidebar cards now keep the workspace name primary, wrap it up to two lines, move agent identity chips below it, and name new default workspaces `Workspace N`. ([#41](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/41)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- The bottom status-bar notification jump control is larger, labeled, and badge-aware; the sidebar help menu now points to c11-owned GitHub, docs, and changelog links. ([#42](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/42)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Default pane tabs are narrower, giving dense multi-agent workspaces more room. ([#44](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/44)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Theme CLI naming now distinguishes c11 chrome themes from Ghostty terminal themes: `c11 themes` manages chrome themes, and `c11 terminal-theme` manages terminal themes. ([#47](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/47)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- The bundled Phosphor c11 theme is now a bright day chrome option. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Welcome terminal and license surfaces now use current c11 branding. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Tagged dev launches now default to a single-pane workspace unless the default pane grid is enabled. ([#46](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/46)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

### Fixed
- The initial main-window chrome layout now reconciles titlebar, sidebar, and content padding during first layout and resize. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Pane close-confirmation dialogs keep keyboard focus so Return, arrows, and Esc control the dialog instead of leaking into browser or terminal panes. ([#43](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/43)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Custom workspace color chrome now keeps the sidebar background neutral, refreshes tab indicators when colors change, and keeps the workspace outline continuous around hosted terminal and browser surfaces. ([#45](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/45)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- c11 theme lookup now uses the renamed bundled `c11-themes` directory and `Application Support/c11` user theme directory. — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

## [0.38.0] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- The product rename from `c11mux` to `c11` is now reflected across structural surfaces, including app naming, release artifacts, Homebrew tap references, docs, and automation. ([#37](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/37)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- **c11 ↔ upstream cmux coexistence.** c11 no longer claims the `cmux` name on the user's system. Practical effects:
  - The "Shell Command: Install…" palette action installs `/usr/local/bin/c11` (previous default: `/usr/local/bin/cmux`). No `cmux` alias is installed.
  - The Homebrew cask (`stage-11-agentics/c11/c11`) no longer creates a `cmux` binary alias and no longer declares `conflicts_with cask: "cmux"`. c11 and upstream cmux can be installed in parallel.
  - The bundled shell integration still prepends the bundled `Resources/bin/` to `PATH` inside c11 terminals, but that directory no longer contains a `cmux` symlink — an upstream `cmux` elsewhere on `PATH` stays visible.
  - `CMUX_*` environment variables are still honored alongside the new `C11_*` variants; socket paths, protocol, and shell-integration file names remain unchanged. ([#38](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/38)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!
- Release DMG is now `c11-macos.dmg` (was `c11mux-macos.dmg`).
- Homebrew cask is `stage-11-agentics/c11/c11` (was `stage-11-agentics/c11mux/c11mux`).

### Fixed
- The "Open c11 app" shell command now runs `open -a c11` (was `open -a cmux`, which failed because the installed bundle is `c11.app`).
- Pane close confirmations no longer leak Return or arrow-key events into embedded browser panes while the confirmation is open. ([#39](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11/pull/39)) — thanks @BenevolentFutures!

### Upgrade notes
- **Stale `/usr/local/bin/cmux` symlinks** created by earlier c11 versions are not removed automatically. `c11 uninstall` only touches `/usr/local/bin/c11`. If you want the stale link gone, remove it manually: `ls -l /usr/local/bin/cmux` to confirm it points at c11, then `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cmux`.
- **Relocated app bundles.** If you move `c11.app` between installs, the in-app uninstall cannot always remove its PATH symlink (the original bundle target is gone). Remove manually with `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/c11` and re-run "Shell Command: Install 'c11' in PATH".
- **Scripts calling `cmux <subcommand>`** keep working only if `cmux` still resolves on PATH via an earlier install or upstream cmux. Update them to `c11 <subcommand>` to rely on c11 alone.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-04-20

First substantive release of the Stage 11 fork after the v0.1.0 versioning reset. Version number tracks the highest Lattice ticket (CMUX-37). 61 commits since v0.1.0; highlights below.

### Added
- **C11-1: Stage 11 fork brand pass.** App display name is **c11**, bundle ID is `com.stage11.c11mux`, release artifact is `c11mux-macos.dmg`, Homebrew tap is `stage-11-agentics/c11mux`, and the Sparkle auto-update feed points at the Stage 11 appcast. The `cmux` CLI binary, `CMUX_*` env vars, socket paths/protocol, and shell-integration files are preserved unchanged for backward compatibility. See [NOTICE](./NOTICE) for attribution. ([#36](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/36))
- **CMUX-40: Skill installer.** Settings → Agent Skills pane, `cmux skills install` CLI, and a first-launch wizard for distributing the cmux skill into Claude Code / Codex / other agent tenants. ([#33](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/33))
- **CMUX-36: Bottom status bar + jump-to-unread.** Per-window status row aggregates per-pane indicators; one-tap jump to the next unread surface. ([#34](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/34))
- **CMUX-35: User themes + hot reload.** Drop a `.theme` in the user themes directory and it appears immediately. Settings picker overload, CLI, and socket command included. ([#31](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/31))
- **CMUX-32: Workspace color prevalence.** Selected workspace tints frame, dividers, and sidebar — clear visual cue for which workspace owns the foreground. ([#30](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/30))
- **CMUX-9 M1: Theme engine foundation.** New theme engine with surface adoption (M1a + M1b), groundwork for the M2+ theming roadmap. ([#28](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/28))
- **CMUX-15: Auto-spawn default pane grid.** New workspaces open with a default pane grid sized to the monitor class. ([#24](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/24); follow-ups for retina, remote, delay, and diagnostics in [#26](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/26))
- **CMUX-11: Pane metadata RPCs + persistence.** Per-pane title and metadata persist across restarts; `cmux pane` CLI for set/get; `--title` flag seeds a launching pane. Phases 1–4. ([#22](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/22), [#25](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/25), [#27](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/27))
- **CMUX-3 (Tier 1 persistence Phase 3): persist `statusEntries`.** Sidebar status entries survive restart. ([#23](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/23))
- **Tier 1 persistence Phase 2: SurfaceMetadataStore.** ([#13](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/13))
- **M10: Pane-scoped close confirmations + `pane.confirm` socket/CLI.** Tab- and workspace-close confirmations render as a card anchored inside the specific panel instead of a window-centered NSAlert; other splits, tabs, and windows remain interactive. Enter / Cmd+D accept, Esc cancels, Tab cycles. Local agents can request panel-anchored confirmations via `cmux pane-confirm` / the `pane.confirm` socket command (exit 0=ok, 2=cancel, 3=dismissed, 1=error). ([#17](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/17))
- **M9: TextBox Input port** from the alumican/cmux-tb fork. ([#14](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/14))
- **M8: `cmux tree` overhaul.** New flags `--window`, `--workspace <id>`, `--all`, `--layout`, `--no-layout`, `--canvas-cols <N>`. Pane lines carry `size=W%×H%`, `px=W×H`, and `split=…` badges. JSON output gains a `layout` sub-object on each pane (`percent`, `pixels`, `split_path`) and a `content_area` on each workspace. Single-workspace text output renders an ASCII floor plan above the hierarchical tree by default.
- **Pane toolbar:** Markdown + NewTab buttons with hover highlight (Bonsplit fork). ([#16](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/16))
- **Radical theme** (bundled).
- **`scripts/prune-tags.sh`** to clean stale `reload.sh --tag` artifacts in DerivedData and `/tmp` (each tag leaves ~3.5 G behind that nothing auto-cleans).

### Changed
- **App menu reordered.** c11mux Settings sits in the top group; Ghostty Settings moves below Services.
- **Theme picker simplified** + dark appearance forced. ([#35](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/35))
- **`cmux tree` defaults to the current workspace.** Use `--window` for the pre-M8 behavior (current window, all workspaces) and `--all` for every window.
- **First-launch defaults:** app fills the screen on first launch; default notification sound is Bottle.
- **Sidebar:** keep custom workspace color when selected. ([#19](https://github.com/Stage-11-Agentics/c11mux/pull/19))
- **README** rewritten in the Stage 11 voice; lineage credits Ghostty and Bonsplit.

### Fixed
- **Pane rename dialog:** button copy is now "Set Tab Title"; arrow / tab / return keyboard nav and contrast in confirm cards.
- **`CMUX_TAB_ID` env var** propagation in c11mux.
