# Divergence Map

Where c11 has diverged from `manaflow-ai/cmux`. The agent uses this as prior knowledge: it knows where to expect adaptation work, and where upstream changes simply don't apply.

## Principle: compatibility bias

When c11 has a feature that overlaps with upstream's, the default move is to align c11 with upstream's naming, parameters, and shape, not to preserve c11's divergent version. Sacrifice compatibility only when there is a concrete reason, and document the reason inline (in the playbook entry, the lessons file, or the relevant code comment) so future readers can audit the call.

This reframes the EVALUATE step. The question is not "does c11 want this upstream change as-is?" It is "does c11 want this functionality, and if c11 already has an overlap, can we adapt c11 toward upstream rather than skip?" Skipping is still a valid answer, but it is the answer of last resort, not the default.

The bias exists because c11 is a fork of cmux, not a separate product. Operators migrate between them. Skills, scripts, and muscle memory written against cmux should keep working in c11 wherever the divergence is not load-bearing. Every divergence we keep is rent the operator pays forever.

**Categories:**

- **`skip`** — there is no c11 equivalent. Upstream changes here have no home in c11. Don't try to land them, even via rewrite.
- **`adapt`** — c11 has its own version, often heavily customized. Upstream changes here likely need rewrite, not cherry-pick. Read the upstream intent, find the c11 equivalent, write the c11 version.

Seeded from `analyze-hotspots.sh` on 2026-05-01 (c11 had 251 unique commits over upstream merge-base `53910919`). Re-run periodically and prune.

## skip

No c11 equivalent. Upstream changes here are not landed.

| Path / glob                              | Why no c11 equivalent                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `homebrew-c11/**` and `homebrew-cmux/**` | c11 has its own homebrew tap; upstream's tap is irrelevant.        |
| `.lattice/**`                            | Lattice (Stage-11 task system) is c11-only.                        |
| `skills/c11/**`                          | c11-only Claude Code skill.                                        |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**`              | c11 issue templates.                                               |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml`          | c11 has its own release stream and version scheme.                 |
| `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`          | c11 has its own nightly bucket and signing.                        |
| `.github/workflows/build-ghosttykit.yml` | c11-specific GhosttyKit build pipeline.                            |
| `.github/workflows/update-homebrew.yml`  | c11-only homebrew tap updater.                                     |
| `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`                      | Static files, c11 carries its own copies; not subject to upstream churn. |

**Note:** identity files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) used to be on this list. They've moved to `adapt` — when an upstream README change is meaningful (e.g. documenting a new feature c11 also imports), the agent should adapt the doc change to c11's voice and shipping equivalent. When the change is purely cmux branding, the adapt step is "skip the change, don't bring it over."

## adapt

c11 has its own version. Upstream changes here usually need rewrite. The agent reads upstream intent, finds the c11 equivalent, writes the c11-shaped change. Often the playbook has a relevant entry.

## How to extend this file

When a triage run hits an adaptation pattern that isn't represented here:

1. Add a row under `adapt` (or `skip` if there's truly no c11 equivalent).
2. Keep the reason to one line. Detail belongs in `playbook.md`.
3. Use globs over exact paths when the divergence is broad.

When a previously-listed area is no longer divergent (we caught back up, or the c11 customization moved), remove the row.

Re-run `scripts/analyze-hotspots.sh --top 80` quarterly to refresh.
