# C11-21: Upstream cmux issues, Input handling (8 picks)

> **Origin reminder:** every `#NNNN` in this note refers to an open **issue** in the upstream parent project [`manaflow-ai/cmux`](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux), not to a c11 issue or PR. The picks were drawn from `code/c11-private/upstream-watch/issues/open.md` after the daily refresh on 2026-04-26.

**Bundle theme:** Small upstream cmux issues affecting input handling: keyboard layouts, IME, paste/clipboard, signals, and keystroke-triggered UI. Disproportionately important because c11 ships in 6 non-English locales (ja, uk, ko, zh-Hans, zh-Hant, ru) and any input-path bug compounds across them.

**Source feed:** `code/c11-private/upstream-watch/` (auto-refreshed daily at 08:00 local).
**Original triage:** `code/c11-private/upstream-watch/picks/2026-04-26-pick-10.md` and `picks/2026-04-26-pick-11-25.md`.
**Sibling tickets:** C11-20 (CLI hygiene), C11-22 (Stability).

## Picks

### #3061 — Cmd+Shift+[ triggers `nextSurface` instead of `prevSurface`
- **Reporter:** @wada811
- **Fix size:** trivial (single keybind table entry)
- **Why c11:** Pure regression in shortcut wiring (likely from cmux PR #2528). c11 inherited the same shortcut table.

### #1456 — Zoom-in not working; zoom-out works fine
- **Reporter:** @DaikiHayata
- **Fix size:** small (asymmetry in font-size handler)
- **Why c11:** Font-size scaling is shared Ghostty/terminal code. Asymmetry suggests one branch missing a sign or a clamp.

### #3096 — Copying soft-wrapped long command inserts hard newlines at wrap points
- **Reporter:** @tmad4000
- **Fix size:** small-medium (terminal selection-to-clipboard path)
- **Why c11:** Lives in shared Ghostty/terminal selection code. Pasting a copied command into another terminal silently breaks it.

### #3069 — Cmd+V paste replaces non-ASCII UTF-8 (Korean Hangul) with `?`
- **Reporter:** @jewel-sallylab (related: @AndreySoloviev #2756, @pankrusheff #2891)
- **Fix size:** small (clipboard encoding pipeline)
- **Why c11:** Shared paste path. **Bonus:** likely closes #2756 (Cyrillic) and #2891 (Qt non-ASCII) — one fix, three issues. High-value, especially given c11's 6-locale shipping story.

### #1469 — Option key characters not reachable on non-US keyboard layouts
- **Reporter:** @alceal
- **Fix size:** small (option-key passthrough in keyboard handler)
- **Why c11:** Shared keyboard path. Blocking option+key on EU/CJK layouts hits real users on every shipping locale.

### #1153 — `alt+backspace` doesn't delete last word

**Status: do NOT relitigate. The full upstream story is below — read before touching this.**

- **Reporter:** @sldx (issue #1153)
- **Fix size:** small if cherry-picked from upstream maintainer commits; medium if reproduced from scratch.
- **Why c11:** Universal macOS convention. Specifically broken in TUI apps (Claude Code, Codex, lazygit, vim) — plain shell hides it via readline's own bindings.

#### Upstream history (read this before re-attempting the fix)

The bug has a five-contributor history. Two community PRs were attempted, neither merged, and the final fix landed as a side effect of broader maintainer keyboard work. The fix is **not in c11** (commits are post our 2026-03-18 fork point).

1. **PR [#1438](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/1438) by @shouryamaanjain (2026-03-14, still OPEN).** Fixed at the `textForKeyEvent` layer.
   - @lawrencecchen (maintainer) couldn't reproduce on German keyboard, asked for repro. PR went stale waiting for a revision that never came.
2. **@judekim0507's diagnosis (2026-03-16).** Critical context drop: the bug only fires in TUI apps, not plain shell. Plain shell hides it because readline maps M-DEL to `backward-kill-word` independently. This explained the maintainer's repro failure.
3. **PR [#2246](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/2246) by @pandec (2026-03-27, CLOSED 2026-04-01).** Different approach with deeper root-cause analysis: AppKit's `interpretKeyEvents → insertText → keyTextAccumulator` path runs **before** `textForKeyEvent`, so #1438's fix point was wrong. Added a fast path for Option+Delete (keyCode 51) mirroring the existing Ctrl fast path. **@pandec self-closed the PR on 2026-04-01 with "Fixed in the latest release."**
4. **What actually fixed it upstream.** Not @pandec's PR (never merged). The fix was a side effect of broader maintainer keyboard work by **@austinywang (Austin Wang)**:
   - `ab46c557` Handle left-side modifier releases (2026-04-13)
   - `fda8daad` Fix modifier release handling after idle (2026-04-12)
   - `151075f7` Avoid character APIs in flagsChanged (2026-04-13)
5. **None of those commits explicitly reference #1153 or #1424.** Issue #1424 (a duplicate of #1153) was closed by @judekim0507 on 2026-04-01 as completed, based on community confirmation that the bug stopped reproducing — not a clean closing PR.

#### Recommended fix path

1. **First, repro in c11** — run `lazygit` or Claude Code or vim inside c11 and try `option+delete`. If the bug doesn't reproduce, close this pick as "fixed by drift" and move on.
2. **If it does reproduce** (likely — c11 doesn't have the maintainer keyboard commits), do **not** revive #1438 or #2246. Cherry-pick the maintainer commits directly: `ab46c557`, `fda8daad`, `151075f7`. Verify each compiles and test the option+delete behavior in TUI apps after each.
3. **Watch for collateral.** These commits touch modifier release handling broadly. Run the full keyboard / IME smoke test (option keys on non-US layouts, Korean/Japanese IME, modifier-held arrow keys) before landing — this is the typing-latency-sensitive area called out in `code/c11/CLAUDE.md`.

#### Credit chain (to preserve in commit messages and PR description)

```
Reported-by: @sldx <upstream issue #1153>
Diagnosed-by: @judekim0507 <TUI-vs-shell context, upstream issue #1424>
First-attempt: @shouryamaanjain <upstream PR #1438 — closed unmerged>
Root-cause: @pandec <upstream PR #2246 — closed unmerged>
Cherry-picked-from: manaflow-ai/cmux@ab46c557 + @fda8daad + @151075f7 by @austinywang
```

If the c11 fix happens to land cleaner than the upstream side-effect path, surface it back upstream as a focused PR per the `code/c11/CLAUDE.md` "Upstream Fixes" guidance.

### #2105 — `ctrl-z` kills process instead of backgrounding
- **Reporter:** @freshtonic
- **Fix size:** small (signal forwarding in PTY layer)
- **Why c11:** Shared shell signal handling. POSIX behavior is broken — real correctness bug.

### #2949 — Modifier press/release events dropped while IME marked text is active
- **Reporter:** @shaun0927
- **Fix size:** small-medium (IME state machine + modifier forwarding)
- **Why c11:** Shared IME path. Reporter has the diagnosis precise.

## Suggested execution

1. Find upstream PRs that fix these (use `code/c11-private/upstream-watch/prs/`). Many of these may be fixed in a single upstream PR each — keyboard work tends to be focused.
2. **Test on real non-English input** for #1469, #3069, #2949 — c11 ships in ja/uk/ko/zh-Hans/zh-Hant/ru, so locale-specific regressions need to be verified per locale before landing.
3. Land #3069 carefully — verify the same fix actually closes #2756 and #2891 before claiming all three; don't credit reporters whose bugs aren't actually fixed.
4. Apply CMUX→C11 rename at integration time only.
5. Consider shipping as 2 PRs: one for "input convention fixes" (#3061, #1456, #1153, #2105) and one for "international paste/IME bundle" (#3069, #1469, #2949, #3096) — the latter benefits from being verified across all c11 shipping locales.
