# CMUX-37 — Workspace persistence: Blueprints + Snapshots + session resume

**Ticket:** CMUX-37 (`task_01KPMTEY4WGECM9MNZ4XARN7Y6`)
**Companion doc:** `docs/c11-snapshot-restore-plan.md`
**Related platform ticket:** C11-7 (`task_01KPS4FBHSSCCJC3EP43YJ7XMZ`) — socket reliability. CMUX-37 depends on it; does not absorb it.
**Related feature ticket:** C11-13 (`task_01KPYFX4PV4QQQYHCPE0R02GEZ`) — inter-agent messaging primitive. Shares the CMUX-11 per-surface metadata layer; see alignment doc below.
**Alignment doc:** [`docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md`](../../docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md) — locked conventions for `mailbox.*` metadata namespace, surface-name addressing, strings-only values for v1, and `WorkspaceApplyPlan` composition path.
**Last refreshed:** 2026-05-03 (final-push plan added at top; older phase plans below kept as historical context)

> **Read me first:** the active plan is **[Final-Push Plan (2026-05-03)](#final-push-plan-2026-05-03)** below. Phases 0 and 1 sections later in this file are historical — they describe work that already shipped via PRs #75, #77, #78, #79. Do not redo that work.

## Final-Push Plan (2026-05-03)

**Goal:** close CMUX-37. Land five workstreams in **one cohesive PR** off branch `cmux-37/final-push`. No follow-up tickets for in-scope items. Operator framing: this ticket has been an albatross; the move is a clean close.

**Ground truth for what's missing:** `/tmp/cmux-37-smoke-report.md` (2026-05-03 smoke pass on tagged build `cmux-37-smoke`).

### Already shipped (don't redo)

- PR #75 (Phase 0): `WorkspaceApplyPlan` value type + `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor`.
- PR #79 (Phases 2–5): `c11 snapshot` / `restore` / `list-snapshots` / `workspace new` / `workspace apply` / `workspace export-blueprint`, browser/markdown surface round-trip, agent registry rows.
- Snapshots persisted as JSON in `~/.c11-snapshots/<ulid>.json` (legacy fallback at `~/.cmux-snapshots/`).
- Blueprints currently persisted as JSON in `~/.config/cmux/blueprints/<name>.json`.
- Built-ins: `agent-room`, `side-by-side`, `basic-terminal`.

### The five workstreams

1. **Markdown blueprint format.** Replace JSON blueprints with Markdown + YAML frontmatter (Obsidian-friendly). Parser `.md → WorkspaceApplyPlan`: YAML frontmatter → workspace metadata (`title`, `description`, `custom_color`); first fenced YAML codeblock under `## Layout` → layout tree → `SurfaceSpec[]`. Writer `WorkspaceApplyPlan → .md` for `workspace export-blueprint`. Default write path renames `~/.config/cmux/blueprints/` → `~/.config/c11/blueprints/`; back-compat **read** of old path stays. `workspace new --blueprint <path>` accepts `.md`. Picker discovers `.md` alongside built-ins. **JSON blueprint reading continues to work** — don't break the shipped path. Round-trip test: export a workspace as `.md`, materialize from that `.md`, compare structure to original.

2. **Snapshot manifest layer for `--all`.** Per-workspace snapshots remain the primitive — no rearchitecture. Add a manifest layer: `snapshot --all` keeps writing N per-workspace files **and** writes one manifest at `~/.c11-snapshots/sets/<ulid>.json` (timestamp, workspace order, selected workspace, c11 version, list of inner snapshot IDs — pointer file only, no data duplication). `restore <id>` becomes polymorphic (single workspace vs. manifest). `list-snapshots --sets` (or sibling `list-snapshot-sets`) for discovery.

3. **Restore diagnostic cleanup.** The smoke validator saw `restore` exit 0 but emit `failure:` lines for expected behaviors: terminal `workingDirectory` ignored on seed terminals, six `metadata_override` warnings for title overrides. Audit `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor` diagnostic emission and reclassify these to `info:` (or silence). Reserve `failure:` for genuine errors.

4. **`c11 workspace <sub> --help` routing.** `c11 workspace new` works; `c11 workspace new --help` says `Unknown command 'workspace'`. Help dispatch for `workspace` subcommands is broken. Fix routing so `c11 workspace <subcmd> --help` reaches the subcommand's help.

5. **CLI socket safety (`C11_SOCKET`).** During smoke setup the orchestrator set `C11_SOCKET=…` thinking it was the override; CLI ignores it (uses `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH`), auto-discovered the live socket via `last-socket-path`, and silently mutated the operator's live workspace. Fixes:
   - Accept `C11_SOCKET` as the **primary** override; keep `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` as a back-compat alias.
   - When auto-discovering from `last-socket-path`, log one stderr line naming the picked socket + pointer file. Suppress with `--quiet` or `C11_QUIET_DISCOVERY=1`.
   - Document precedence in `c11 --help`: `--socket` flag → `C11_SOCKET` → `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` → auto-discovery.
   - **Don't** add a deprecation warning on `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` yet — that's a separate ticket.

### Housekeeping (fold into the same PR)

- Rename ticket title (`lattice update CMUX-37 --title …`): drop "c11mux" → "c11". Update description prose accordingly.
- Strip the stale "plan freshness warning" block from the ticket description.
- Do **not** rename historical commits, shipped public identifiers, or env var aliases.

### Parallelization

The five workstreams have **low file overlap**, so impl can be split:

| Workstream | Primary surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Markdown blueprints | New parser/writer files; `Sources/Workspace*Blueprint*.swift`; `CLI/c11.swift` blueprint flag handler | Largest. Independent. |
| 2. Manifest layer | `Sources/WorkspaceSnapshotStore.swift`; `CLI/c11.swift` snapshot/restore/list handlers | Touches snapshot CLI. |
| 3. Diagnostic cleanup | `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift` | Surgical reclassification. |
| 4. `workspace --help` routing | `CLI/c11.swift` arg-parse / help dispatch | Surgical. |
| 5. `C11_SOCKET` + discovery log | `CLI/c11.swift` socket resolution; `c11 --help` text | Surgical. |

Recommendation: spawn **two impl siblings** — one for (1) Markdown blueprints (the bulk), one bundling (2) + (3) + (4) + (5) (all relatively small, mostly CLI/executor). Avoid three+ siblings: (3)/(4)/(5) all touch `CLI/c11.swift` and would conflict.

### Commit grouping (rough; impl can refine)

1. Markdown blueprint parser (read path) + tests.
2. Markdown blueprint writer + `export-blueprint` default to `.md` + back-compat JSON read + tests.
3. `~/.config/c11/blueprints/` rename with legacy-path read fallback.
4. Snapshot manifest writer + `snapshot --all` writes manifest pointer.
5. `restore` polymorphism + `list-snapshots --sets`.
6. `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor` diagnostic reclassification.
7. `workspace --help` routing fix.
8. `C11_SOCKET` env var precedence + discovery stderr log + `--help` doc.
9. Localization sweep (translator sub-agent, parallel per locale) for any new user-facing strings introduced.
10. Ticket title/description rename + plan-freshness-warning strip (post-impl, before PR open).

### Acceptance (validation phase will check)

- Round-trip a workspace: export as `.md`, `cat` shows YAML frontmatter + `## Layout` codeblock, `workspace new --blueprint <that.md>` materializes a matching workspace.
- `snapshot --all` writes per-workspace files **and** a manifest under `sets/`. `restore <manifest-id>` rehydrates all listed workspaces and re-establishes selection.
- `restore <single-id>` shows no `failure:` lines for the seven previously-noisy expected conditions.
- `c11 workspace new --help` and `c11 workspace export-blueprint --help` print real help, not "Unknown command".
- `C11_SOCKET=/tmp/c11-debug-cmux-37-final.sock c11 ping` hits the smoke build, not the live workspace. `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH=…` still works. Auto-discovery emits a stderr breadcrumb.

### Do NOT ship in this PR

- Deprecation warning on `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` (future ticket).
- Any changes to typing-latency-sensitive paths in `WindowTerminalHostView.hitTest`, `TabItemView`, `TerminalSurface.forceRefresh`. Workstreams above don't need them.
- Renaming public CMUX-* commit identifiers, the historical `cmux` CLI compat alias, or shipped public APIs.
- Restructuring the existing JSON blueprint reader. Read path is preserved.

### Phase model from here

- **Plan (this section).** Done; if Plan sibling wants to refine, it edits this section in place.
- **Impl.** Two siblings per parallelization table.
- **Translator.** Spawn per-locale only if new user-facing strings appear (likely a couple of error messages in the Markdown parser; the help text changes too).
- **Review.** `trident-code-review`. Apply-by-default fixes inline; surface escalations via Lattice comment. Max 3 rework cycles.
- **Validate.** Tagged build `cmux-37-final`; codex computer-use validation against the acceptance bullets above; report to `/tmp/cmux-37-final-smoke-report.md`. Validate sibling MUST pin `--socket /tmp/c11-debug-cmux-37-final.sock` on every CLI call (the wrong-socket disaster from the smoke pass is what workstream 5 fixes; until 5 lands and is in the smoke build, sub-agents must be explicit).
- **Handoff.** PR open against `main`, attach to ticket, `lattice comment` summary, leave at `review` for operator merge. Do not call `lattice complete`.

## What this is

One ticket delivering two persistence concepts on a shared app-side primitive:

- **Blueprints** — declarative markdown that defines the initial shape of a workspace. Checked into git, shareable, per-repo (`.cmux/blueprints/*.md`) or per-user (`~/.config/cmux/blueprints/*.md`).
- **Snapshots** — auto-generated JSON capturing exact live state for crash/restart recovery. Per-user (`~/.cmux-snapshots/`).

Both compile to a `WorkspaceApplyPlan` executed **app-side in one transaction**. Not CLI/socket choreography — the 2026-04-21 dogfood proved that route fails. Both share a known-type restart registry: `claude-code + session_id → cc --resume <id>`.

## The hard constraint

**App-side transaction, not shell choreography.** A `WorkspaceApplyPlan` describes the end state; the app materializes it in one pass. The CLI sends one structured request; the app handles creation, lifecycle waiting, metadata, and ref assignment internally. Blueprints and snapshot-restore MUST route through this — never an internal loop that shells out to existing CLI commands.

## Core primitive

`WorkspaceApplyPlan` — new value type:

```swift
struct WorkspaceApplyPlan: Codable {
    var workspace: WorkspaceSpec
    var layout: LayoutTreeSpec        // nested split tree, not flat
    var surfaces: [SurfaceSpec]       // keyed by stable local ids referenced from LayoutTreeSpec
}

struct SurfaceSpec: Codable {
    var id: String                    // plan-local, not a live ref
    var type: SurfaceType             // terminal | browser | markdown
    var title: String?
    var description: String?
    var cwd: String?
    var command: String?              // terminal: initial command to send
    var url: String?                  // browser
    var file: String?                 // markdown
    var metadata: [String: JSONValue] // surface metadata (including restart registry keys)
    var pane_metadata: [String: JSONValue] // pane metadata (including mailbox.* keys per C11-13 alignment)
}
```

Nested `LayoutTreeSpec` mirrors `SessionWorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` (`Sources/SessionPersistence.swift:360-428`) so Snapshots convert trivially.

**C11-13 coordination:** `pane_metadata` must faithfully round-trip any keys under the reserved `mailbox.*` namespace without modification. For v1 both systems treat metadata values as strings; if CMUX-37 wants structured JSON values earlier, coordinate the `PaneMetadataStore`/`SurfaceMetadataStore` schema migration with C11-13 jointly. See `docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md`.

## Executor

New file: `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift`. One entry point (shipped
sync in Phase 0 — the walk has no await points; Phase 1's readiness pass
will reintroduce `async` when surface-ready awaiting lands):

```swift
@MainActor
enum WorkspaceLayoutExecutor {
    static func apply(
        _ plan: WorkspaceApplyPlan,
        options: ApplyOptions = ApplyOptions(),
        dependencies: WorkspaceLayoutExecutorDependencies
    ) -> ApplyResult
}
```

- Creates the workspace (routes through `TabManager.addWorkspace` at `Sources/TabManager.swift:1138`).
- Walks the layout tree, calling existing split primitives on `Workspace` (`Sources/Workspace.swift` — `newTerminalSplit`, `newBrowserSplit`, `newMarkdownSplit`) to build the bonsplit tree.
- Applies titles, descriptions, surface metadata, pane metadata **during creation**, not as post-hoc socket calls. Writes go to `SurfaceMetadataStore` (`Sources/SurfaceMetadataStore.swift:63`) and `PaneMetadataStore` (`Sources/PaneMetadataStore.swift:22`) directly.
- Returns `{ workspace_ref, pane_refs, surface_refs, timings: [StepTiming], warnings: [String] }`.
- Distinguishes readiness states where practical: `created`, `attached`, `rendered`, `ready`.
- Structured partial failures: which step failed, which refs were created.

Welcome quad (`Sources/c11App.swift:3932-3995` — `WelcomeSettings.performQuadLayout`) and any other existing initial-layout flow should be re-expressed through this primitive where practical, confirming the design is general.

## Socket / CLI surface

**v2 socket method:**
```
workspace.apply(plan, options) -> { workspace_ref, pane_refs, surface_refs, timings, warnings }
```

**CLI:**
```
c11 workspace new --blueprint <path>
c11 workspace export-blueprint --workspace <ref> --out <path>
c11 workspace apply --file <path-or-json>          # lower-level/debug
c11 snapshot [--workspace <ref> | --all]
c11 restore <snapshot-id-or-path>
c11 list-snapshots
```

The `cmux` alias carries all of these (compat).

## Blueprint format

Markdown + YAML frontmatter. Exact schema finalized in Phase 2. Target shape:

```markdown
---
name: debug-auth
description: Auth module debugging layout
---

## Panes
- main  | `cc`              | cwd: ~/repo          | claude.session_id: abc123
- logs  | `tail -f log.txt` | split: right of main
- tests | `vitest --watch`  | split: below logs
```

**Idempotency:** applies at workspace creation only. Live workspace is the user's to mutate. "Re-apply" = close and reopen.

## Restart registry

Shared across Blueprints and Snapshots. Rows added per agent type without schema changes:

| terminal_type | With session_id                  | Without  |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| `claude-code` | `cc --resume <session_id>`       | `cc`     |
| `codex`       | `codex resume <session_id>` or `--last` | `codex` |
| `opencode`    | `opencode -s <session_id>` or `-c` | `opencode` |
| *unknown*     | —                                | leave empty |

For cc: the grandfathered `Resources/bin/claude` wrapper already mints `--session-id <uuid>` on every launch; `c11 claude-hook session-start` (`CLI/c11.swift:2403`, handler at `:12198`) persists id + cwd to `~/.cmuxterm/claude-hook-sessions.json`. Phase 1 adds one line to that handler: also write `agent.claude.session_id` into `SurfaceMetadataStore` via the existing persistence path. Round-trip through the Tier-1 autosave comes for free.

For codex/opencode: rely on `--last`/`-c` initially; teach agents to self-report via `c11 set-metadata --key agent.session_id …` from the `c11` skill (observe-from-outside principle).

## New-workspace picker

Empty state of `c11 workspace new` (no args) shows a merged, recency-sorted picker:
1. Per-repo Blueprints
2. Per-user Blueprints
3. Built-in starter Blueprints

Subsumes the recovery-banner UX from (superseded) CMUX-5.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — `WorkspaceApplyPlan` + executor
- New value type `WorkspaceApplyPlan` (extends or lives adjacent to `SessionPersistence.swift:462+`'s `AppSessionSnapshot`).
- New file `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift` with the `apply` entry point.
- Re-express `WelcomeSettings.performQuadLayout` through the executor (or at minimum, demonstrate the executor can produce the same workspace shape).
- v2 socket method `workspace.apply`.
- CLI `c11 workspace apply --file <path>` as the debug/test surface.
- **No Blueprints, no Snapshots, no restart registry yet.** This phase lands the primitive and nothing else.

### Phase 1 — Core subcommands + Snapshots + Claude resume
- `c11 snapshot`, `c11 restore`, `c11 list-snapshots`.
- Snapshot writer: walks live workspace state, emits `WorkspaceApplyPlan` JSON to `~/.cmux-snapshots/`.
- Snapshot reader: loads JSON → `WorkspaceApplyPlan` → `apply()`.
- Restart registry (cc only; `cc --resume <id>` + JSONL-missing fallback).
- Claude-hook handler writes `agent.claude.session_id` into `SurfaceMetadataStore`.
- Opt-in via env flag (`C11_SESSION_RESUME=1`) for one release, on-by-default after.
- Terminal surfaces only; single workspace scope (`--workspace` to pick, default current).

### Phase 2 — Blueprint format + picker + exporter
- Blueprint markdown schema + parser.
- `c11 workspace new --blueprint <path>`.
- New-workspace picker: per-repo → per-user → built-in, recency-sorted.
- `c11 workspace export-blueprint --workspace <ref> --out <path>` captures live layout.

### Phase 3 — Browser/markdown surfaces + `--all`
- Extend Snapshot capture + restore to non-terminal surfaces.
- Extend Blueprint schema to cover browser/markdown.
- `c11 snapshot --all` for multi-workspace.

### Phase 4 — Skill docs + hook snippet
- Add "Session resume" section to `~/.claude/skills/c11/SKILL.md` with operator-install instructions (c11 never installs the hook).
- Document `agent.*.session_id` as a non-canonical-but-recognized metadata convention.

### Phase 5 — codex / kimi / opencode registry rows
- Add per-agent restart commands. Driven by user demand + agent-side `set-metadata` support.

## Dependencies on C11-7 (socket reliability)

Phase 0 consumes, does not absorb:
- Bounded CLI waits by default.
- Named timeout errors (method/command/refs/socket path/elapsed).
- `C11_TRACE=1` per-command start/end/timing.
- `c11 notify` on v2 (off legacy `notify_target`).
- Audit of `DispatchQueue.main.sync` socket handlers (the v1 path has 103 instances in `TerminalController.swift`).
- Deadline-aware main-actor bridge for handlers that must touch AppKit.

The 5-workspace perf fixture (target ~2s or fail fast) is CMUX-37's acceptance test and rides C11-7's stress fixture.

## Performance / reliability acceptance

- One `workspace.apply` creates a 5-workspace mixed fixture (terminal + browser + markdown + metadata + titles + descriptions) in ~2s on a normal dev machine, or fails fast with a named timeout.
- Executor returns per-step timings in debug/JSON output.
- Every readiness wait is bounded and named in the error.
- Regression fixture lives alongside C11-7's stress test.

## Principle check

- **Unopinionated about the terminal.** Writes only to `~/.cmux-snapshots/` (Snapshots) and `.cmux/blueprints/` or `~/.config/cmux/blueprints/` (Blueprints). Does not touch tenant tool settings.
- **Observe-from-outside session capture.** Claude session id via operator-installed SessionStart hook (documented in the `c11` skill). Never c11-installed.
- **Automation is a first-class consumer.** Structured, bounded, inspectable, fast.

## Supersedes

- CMUX-4 (manual Claude session index) — hook-driven capture replaces JSONL discovery.
- CMUX-5 (recovery UI banner) — subsumed by the new-workspace picker + restart registry.

Restore preserves CMUX-11 pane manifests + CMUX-14 lineage chains verbatim.

## Prior art (acknowledged, not adopted)

- `sanghun0724/cmux-claude-skills` — private session JSON + spinner-char detection + fuzzy ID matching. We use the public manifest.
- `drolosoft/cmux-resurrect` (crex) — community save/restore for upstream `manaflow-ai/cmux`, adjacent design. Inspired the Blueprint/Snapshot naming. c11 keeps the primitive narrower; templates/REPL/daemon stay ecosystem territory.

## Historical (shipped) — Phase 0 Implementation Plan (2026-04-24)

> Shipped via PR #75 (0111f0e4, 2026-04-24). Kept for context; do not redo.



*Agent:* `agent:claude-opus-4-7-cmux-37-plan`. Scope is the `WorkspaceApplyPlan` value type and the app-side `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor` only — no Blueprints, Snapshots, restart registry, or CLI sugar beyond the one debug entry point. Later phases build on top.

### 1. Value types

All new types live in a single new file **`Sources/WorkspaceApplyPlan.swift`**, with small extensions added to existing stores where noted. Types are `Codable, Sendable, Equatable` unless noted.

**Reuse `PersistedJSONValue` as the metadata value flavor.** It already exists at `Sources/PersistedMetadata.swift:10` with the exact shape we need (`string | number | bool | array | object | null`), already round-trips through `PaneMetadataStore` and `SurfaceMetadataStore` via the `PersistedMetadataBridge` at `Sources/PersistedMetadata.swift:77-307`, and already composes with `SessionWorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` at `Sources/SessionPersistence.swift:331` / `:379`. Introducing a second JSON flavor would force a conversion layer at exactly the boundaries that are load-bearing for the executor. Per the C11-13 alignment doc (`docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md`:49-55) **v1 only writes `.string(...)` values**; the executor fails fast with a typed warning on non-string values in reserved pane keys, but the codable shape stays JSON-complete so v1.1+ can ship structured values without a schema migration. No new `JSONValue`/`AnyCodable` — if the codebase later grows a canonical alias, `typealias WorkspaceJSONValue = PersistedJSONValue` is the follow-up.

}
```

**Rationale for shape choices (cited):**

- `WorkspaceSpec.metadata: [String: String]?` matches `SessionWorkspaceSnapshot.metadata` at `Sources/SessionPersistence.swift:447` exactly — Phase 1 Snapshot restore becomes a one-line assignment.
- `SurfaceSpec.metadata` / `SurfaceSpec.paneMetadata` use `[String: PersistedJSONValue]?`, which is the same shape `SessionPanelSnapshot.metadata` (`Sources/SessionPersistence.swift:331`) and `SessionPaneLayoutSnapshot.metadata` (`Sources/SessionPersistence.swift:379`) already carry. The executor decodes via `PersistedMetadataBridge.decodeValues` (`Sources/PersistedMetadata.swift:171`) before handing the `[String: Any]` to the stores.
- `LayoutTreeSpec` mirrors `SessionWorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` keys and orientation enum so `Phase 1 Snapshot.capture` is `SessionWorkspaceLayoutSnapshot → LayoutTreeSpec` via a 20-line translator, not a rewrite.
- `ApplyResult.surfaceRefs`/`paneRefs` map plan-local ids → live refs, making Blueprint/Snapshot re-materialization straightforward in Phase 1 without leaking live UUIDs into the persisted format.

### 2. File layout

**New files:**

- `Sources/WorkspaceApplyPlan.swift` — value types (section 1). Single file, ~250 LOC including Codable boilerplate. No behavior.
- `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift` — the `@MainActor` executor (section 3). ~400 LOC including diagnostics.
- `c11Tests/WorkspaceApplyPlanCodableTests.swift` — round-trip Codable tests for every value type, including a mixed-kind LayoutTreeSpec and `mailbox.*` keys in `paneMetadata`. Pure struct tests, no AppKit — runs in the existing `c11Tests` target (registered under `F1000004A1B2C3D4E5F60718` in `GhosttyTabs.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:834`).
- `c11Tests/WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift` — the 5-workspace acceptance fixture (section 6). Runs through the executor on a real `TabManager`; uses existing test harness patterns from `DefaultGridSettingsTests.swift` and `MetadataPersistenceRoundTripTests.swift`.
- `c11Tests/Fixtures/workspace-apply-plans/` — one JSON per workspace in the acceptance set, decoded via `JSONDecoder`. Human-readable; doubles as Phase 2 Blueprint reference material.

**Modified files:**

- `Sources/Workspace.swift` — no new split primitive. Add one internal helper `func paneIdForPanel(_ panelId: UUID) -> PaneID?` alongside `surfaceIdFromPanelId` at `Sources/Workspace.swift:5599` (the inline loop inside `newTerminalSplit` at `:7215-7223` already does this; extract it so the executor can resolve the pane of a just-created panel without re-walking). Small refactor, keeps existing call sites unchanged.
- `Sources/TabManager.swift` — add `func workspaceRef(for workspaceId: UUID) -> String?` if one doesn't already exist; otherwise reuse the v2 ref minting used by `workspace.create` at `Sources/TerminalController.swift:2066` (`v2WorkspaceCreate` is the anchor). Grep the v2 handler to find the canonical ref helper before adding a duplicate.
- `Sources/c11App.swift` at lines `3983-4040` (`WelcomeSettings.performQuadLayout`) and `4042-4141` (`DefaultGridSettings.performDefaultGrid`) — **keep today's call sites as-is** (partial migration; see section 5). Add one `// TODO(CMUX-37 Phase 0+): migrate to WorkspaceLayoutExecutor once the executor supports post-create-on-existing-workspace mode.` comment on each.
- `Sources/TerminalController.swift` — register one new v2 handler `case "workspace.apply":` in the switch starting at `Sources/TerminalController.swift:2062` (register immediately after the existing workspace commands, e.g. after `workspace.clear_metadata` at `:2101`). Handler decodes `WorkspaceApplyPlan` from params, calls `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.apply`, returns `ApplyResult` as a JSON dict. This is the **debug/test surface only** for Phase 0; the CLI wiring (`c11 workspace apply --file <path>`) is a one-command add in `CLI/c11.swift` near the existing `workspace.create` call at `:1724` but is **optional** for Phase 0 — the acceptance fixture drives the executor through a direct call, so the socket surface can slip to Phase 1 if Impl is scope-constrained. If shipped in Phase 0, keep the CLI one-liner minimal: read file → `sendV2(method: "workspace.apply", params: [...])` → pretty-print result.

Nothing else changes. No new Swift package, no new target, no Resources changes.

### 3. Executor walk — `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.apply(_:options:) async -> ApplyResult`

Single `@MainActor` function. Numbered steps; each wraps a timing record.

1. **Validate plan locally (no AppKit).** Walk `plan.surfaces` for duplicate `id`s, walk `plan.layout` for unknown surface id references, reject empty panes. Validation failures short-circuit to `ApplyResult` with the workspace never created; `failures` names the bad id. No partial workspace is ever created on a validation error. Timing step: `"validate"`.
2. **Create workspace.** Call `TabManager.shared.addWorkspace(workingDirectory: plan.workspace.workingDirectory, initialTerminalCommand: nil, select: options.select, eagerLoadTerminal: false, autoWelcomeIfNeeded: options.autoWelcomeIfNeeded)` (`Sources/TabManager.swift:1138`). Critical: **pass `autoWelcomeIfNeeded: false`** so the executor never collides with welcome/default-grid auto-spawns — those are Phase 0+5 migration targets, not executor dependencies. Capture the returned `Workspace`. Apply `plan.workspace.title` via `workspace.setCustomTitle` and `plan.workspace.customColor` via `workspace.setCustomColor` (existing setters at `Sources/Workspace.swift:6019+`). Timing step: `"workspace.create"`.
3. **Apply workspace-level metadata.** For each `(key, value)` in `plan.workspace.metadata`, mirror whatever persistence path `SessionWorkspaceSnapshot.metadata` uses today (confirmed via `Sources/SessionPersistence.swift:447` round-trip; if it's a dedicated setter, call it — if it's direct dictionary assignment on `Workspace`, proxy through a new `Workspace.setOperatorMetadata(key:value:)` helper that mirrors `setPanelCustomTitle`'s shape). Timing step: `"metadata.workspace.write"`.
4. **Seed root pane with the first leaf's initial surface.** `TabManager.addWorkspace` always creates a seed `TerminalPanel` in a single root pane. Walk `plan.layout` and find the first leaf (`LayoutTreeSpec.pane`); its first `surfaceId` maps onto that seed panel:
   - If the first surface is `.terminal`, **reuse** the seed. Rename via `setPanelCustomTitle` and apply metadata (step 6).
   - If the first surface is `.browser` or `.markdown`, **replace** the seed: open the target kind in the same pane via `newBrowserSurface` / `newMarkdownSurface` equivalent in-pane creation (no `newXSplit` — those create a new pane), then close the seed terminal panel. Open question in section 9.
   This keeps the invariant "one pane per LayoutTreeSpec.pane node" without an extra seed pane.
5. **Walk the layout tree and materialize splits.** Depth-first traversal. For each `LayoutTreeSpec.split` encountered:
   - Pick the "parent" panel = the tail of whatever the `first` subtree resolves to (for `split.first` we descend into `first` and remember the last panel id we created there; for `split.second` we split off that panel).
   - Call `workspace.newTerminalSplit(from: parentPanelId, orientation: split.orientation, insertFirst: false, focus: false)` (`Sources/Workspace.swift:7208`) — or `newBrowserSplit` (`:7408`) / `newMarkdownSplit` (`:7568`) depending on the first surface kind of the leaf we're creating inside the new pane. `focus: false` is mandatory — the executor does not steal focus per `CLAUDE.md` socket focus policy.
   - Apply the `split.dividerPosition` via whatever bonsplit setter already exists (grep `dividerPosition` / `divider_position` in `Sources/Workspace.swift` — likely `bonsplitController.setDividerPosition(paneId:position:)` or similar; if it doesn't exist, file a small follow-up and accept default in Phase 0).
   - For each additional `surfaceId` in the pane (`surfaceIds.count > 1`): call `workspace.newTerminalSurface(inPane:)` (`:7327`) / `newBrowserSurface` (`:7495`) / equivalent markdown in-pane create. Apply title/metadata.
   - Apply `PaneSpec.selectedIndex` via the existing tab-select path (`bonsplitController.selectTab` is the final call in both split primitives today — expose the tab id and call it).
   - Timing steps: `"layout.split[<index>].create"` per split, `"surface[<planId>].create"` per surface.
6. **Apply surface + pane metadata during creation.** Immediately after each surface's panel exists (still inside step 4/5, not as a post-hoc second pass):
   - **Surface title** (if set): `workspace.setPanelCustomTitle(panelId:title:)` at `Sources/Workspace.swift:5854`. This already writes the canonical `title` key into `SurfaceMetadataStore` (`:5872-5878`) — no double-write.
   - **Surface description** (if set): `SurfaceMetadataStore.shared.setMetadata(workspaceId: workspace.id, surfaceId: panelId, partial: ["description": trimmed], mode: .merge, source: .explicit)` — `description` is already in the reserved key set at `Sources/SurfaceMetadataStore.swift:143-152` and validates as a string.
   - **Rest of surface metadata**: for every `(key, value)` in `surfaceSpec.metadata` besides `title`/`description` (which the above two already wrote), decode via `PersistedMetadataBridge.decodeValues([key: value])` (`Sources/PersistedMetadata.swift:171`) and call `SurfaceMetadataStore.shared.setMetadata(..., mode: .merge, source: .explicit)`. Keys that collide with `title`/`description` take the explicit `metadata` value and emit an `ApplyFailure("metadata_override")` warning — the spec is ambiguous if a caller sets both.
   - **Pane metadata**: resolve the panel's hosting pane via the new `paneIdForPanel` helper (section 2 modifications). For every `(key, value)` in `surfaceSpec.paneMetadata`, decode and call `PaneMetadataStore.shared.setMetadata(workspaceId: workspace.id, paneId: paneId, partial: [key: decoded], mode: .merge, source: .explicit)` (`Sources/PaneMetadataStore.swift:59`). **v1 strings-only contract:** before decoding, if `key` matches `^mailbox\.` and `value` is not `.string`, append an `ApplyFailure("mailbox_non_string_value", ...)` warning and skip the write. The surface is still created; only the offending key is dropped. Per alignment doc `docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md:49-55`.
   - Timing steps: `"metadata.surface[<planId>].write"` and `"metadata.pane[<planId>].write"` rolled up per surface.
7. **Apply terminal initial command.** For each terminal surface where `command` is set, schedule a `sendText` via the existing `TerminalPanel.sendText` path — it already auto-queues pre-surface-ready and flushes on ready (`Sources/c11App.swift:3997-3999` documents this behavior for `performQuadLayout`). The executor does not `await` surface readiness; that's Phase 1's `readiness: ready` pass. Timing step: `"surface[<planId>].command.enqueue"`.
8. **Assemble refs.** For each `SurfaceSpec`, mint `surface:N` and `pane:N` via the same v2 ref helper `workspace.create` uses (`Sources/TerminalController.swift:2066`). Build `ApplyResult.surfaceRefs` / `paneRefs` keyed by plan-local `SurfaceSpec.id`. Mint `workspaceRef`. Timing step: `"refs.assemble"`.
9. **Return.** Emit `StepTiming("total", ...)` covering the full `apply()` duration and return `ApplyResult`.

**Partial-failure handling lives in step 5 and step 6.** A failed split (e.g., bonsplit rejects the geometry) appends an `ApplyFailure("split_failed", step: "layout.split[<i>].create", ...)`, skips the subtree rooted at that split, and continues with the next peer split. A failed metadata write appends `ApplyFailure("metadata_write_failed", ...)` but the surface stays alive. The workspace itself is **never rolled back** — leaving a partial workspace on-screen is better UX than a silent disappear, and matches today's `performDefaultGrid` truncate-on-failure behavior (`Sources/c11App.swift:4100-4116`).

### 4. Metadata write path — summary table

| Plan field | Store | API | Source | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WorkspaceSpec.metadata` | `Workspace.metadata` (matches `SessionWorkspaceSnapshot.metadata` at `SessionPersistence.swift:447`) | direct or new `Workspace.setOperatorMetadata` helper | `.explicit` | step 3, right after workspace create |
| `SurfaceSpec.title` | `SurfaceMetadataStore` key `title` | `workspace.setPanelCustomTitle` at `Workspace.swift:5854` (already writes the canonical key) | `.explicit` | step 6, during surface creation |
| `SurfaceSpec.description` | `SurfaceMetadataStore` key `description` | `SurfaceMetadataStore.shared.setMetadata(..., .merge, .explicit)` at `SurfaceMetadataStore.swift:245` | `.explicit` | step 6, during surface creation |
| `SurfaceSpec.metadata[*]` | `SurfaceMetadataStore` | `setMetadata(..., .merge, .explicit)` | `.explicit` | step 6, during surface creation |
| `SurfaceSpec.paneMetadata[*]` | `PaneMetadataStore` | `setMetadata(..., .merge, .explicit)` at `PaneMetadataStore.swift:59` | `.explicit` | step 6, during surface creation |
| `SurfaceSpec.paneMetadata["mailbox.*"]` | `PaneMetadataStore` | same as above; strings only; executor-level type guard drops non-string values with a warning | `.explicit` | step 6 |

**All writes happen during creation, not after.** No post-hoc `c11 set-metadata` round trip, no socket call loop. This matches the locked composition convention in `docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md:58-65`.

**`mailbox.*` round-trip invariant.** The executor never rewrites, normalizes, or validates `mailbox.*` keys beyond the string-value type guard. Blueprints and Snapshots can carry `mailbox.delivery = "stdin,watch"`, `mailbox.subscribe = "build.*,deploy.green"`, `mailbox.retention_days = "7"` verbatim. The executor decodes `.string(s)` → `s` and hands it to `PaneMetadataStore.setMetadata`. v1.1+ values stay strings (comma-separated lists, stringified ints) until the joint schema migration described in the alignment doc (`:49-55`).

**Strings-only contract today.** If `PaneMetadataStore` later grows native structured values, the executor's decode step (`PersistedMetadataBridge.decodeValues`) already round-trips arrays/objects — no executor change needed at that migration.

### 5. Welcome-quad / default-grid migration

**Scope call for Phase 0: design the executor so both can converge; migrate neither today.** Both call sites are load-bearing on app startup and ship with behavioral tests (`DefaultGridSettingsTests.swift`). A migration that reshapes startup sequencing risks regressions that Phase 0 isn't set up to catch (no local-run path per `CLAUDE.md`; E2E must go through `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml`). Phase 0 ships the primitive; migration lands in a follow-up.

**Welcome-quad (`Sources/c11App.swift:3983-4040`):**
- (a) Lives at `WelcomeSettings.performQuadLayout(on:initialPanel:)`, called by `TabManager.addWorkspace` indirectly via `sendWelcomeCommandWhenReady` (`TabManager.swift:1213`) once the initial Ghostty surface is ready.
- (b) **Not migrated in Phase 0.** Both call sites unchanged.
- (c) TODO comment at line 4000, above `performQuadLayout`:
  ```
  // TODO(CMUX-37 Phase 0+): express the quad as a WorkspaceApplyPlan and
  // apply via WorkspaceLayoutExecutor. The current implementation runs on an
  // already-created workspace with a live terminal panel; the executor
  // assumes workspace-creation responsibility. Migration path: extend
  // WorkspaceLayoutExecutor with an `applyTo(existing:Workspace)` overload
  // that skips step 2 and reuses the seed panel.
  ```
- (d) **Risk to startup behavior: none.** No edit to this function in Phase 0.

**Default-grid (`Sources/c11App.swift:4042-4141`):**
- (a) Lives at `DefaultGridSettings.performDefaultGrid(on:initialPanel:)`, called by `TabManager.spawnDefaultGridWhenReady` (`TabManager.swift:1290-1292`) and `AppDelegate.spawnDefaultGridWhenReady` (`AppDelegate.swift:6349-6351`).
- (b) **Not migrated in Phase 0.** Same rationale.
- (c) TODO comment at line 4082, above `performDefaultGrid`:
  ```
  // TODO(CMUX-37 Phase 0+): express the 2x2 grid as a WorkspaceApplyPlan
  // driven by DefaultGridSettings.gridSplitOperations(). Gated on the
  // apply-to-existing-workspace overload. Remote-workspace guard at
  // line 4089 must move into the executor or stay at the call site.
  ```
- (d) **Risk to startup behavior: none.** No edit to this function in Phase 0.

**Executor design bar that enables migration.** The `apply(_:options:)` signature stays creation-centric, but the internal layout walk (steps 4-5) is written against `Workspace` as an injected reference — not a freshly-minted one. Adding an `applyToExistingWorkspace(_ plan: WorkspaceApplyPlan, workspace: Workspace, seedPanel: TerminalPanel?) async -> ApplyResult` in the follow-up is purely a public-API extension, not a refactor. Phase 0's acceptance fixture validates that the creation-centric path reproduces the welcome-quad and default-grid shapes exactly (see section 6).

### 6. Acceptance fixture

**Location:** `c11Tests/WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift`. Runs in the existing `c11Tests` target (`GhosttyTabs.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:834`). JSON fixtures at `c11Tests/Fixtures/workspace-apply-plans/*.json`.

**Structure:** One `XCTestCase` with five `async` test methods, each materializing one `WorkspaceApplyPlan` through `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.apply` on a real `TabManager` instance (no mocks — per `CLAUDE.md` test policy, real runtime behavior only). The five workspaces cover the matrix:

1. `welcome-quad.json` — TL terminal + TR browser + BL markdown + BR terminal; mirrors `performQuadLayout` exactly. Asserts the resulting pane tree matches a structural fingerprint.
2. `default-grid.json` — 2x2 all-terminal. Mirrors `performDefaultGrid`.
3. `single-large-with-metadata.json` — one terminal surface; surface metadata carries `{role: "driver", status: "ready", task: "cmux-37"}`; pane metadata carries `{"mailbox.delivery": "stdin,watch", "mailbox.subscribe": "build.*"}`; asserts post-apply store reads round-trip the values.
4. `mixed-browser-markdown.json` — browser + markdown side-by-side + two terminal panes below; exercises mid-tree browser/markdown creation.
5. `deep-nested-splits.json` — 4-level nested splits with mixed orientations; exercises the depth-first layout walker, dividerPosition application, and parent-panel bookkeeping.

**One consolidated acceptance test** drives the full 5-workspace set through **one loop** and asserts `sum(StepTiming.durationMs) < 2_000` for each workspace individually. This is the fixture referenced in the plan's "Performance / reliability acceptance" section (`:181-185`). Per-step timings from `ApplyResult.timings` emit as XCTest `XCTPerformanceMetric` measurements so CI can track regressions.

**Invocation under CI:** runs as part of the unit test target in `ci.yml` (the existing `c11-unit` scheme; path verified via `project.pbxproj:834-849`). **Per `CLAUDE.md` the impl agent never runs tests locally** — `xcodebuild -scheme c11-unit` is only safe for CI. UI/E2E layer runs via `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml` (workflow at `.github/workflows/test-e2e.yml:1`) with `test_filter=WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests`. Validation is CI-only; the plan's impl agent commits the fixture and triggers the workflow, never runs it locally.

**Acceptance gate for CI:** the workflow's pass criterion is `total < 2_000 ms` across all five fixtures run sequentially on a clean macos-15 runner. Fail-fast: if any single fixture exceeds `ApplyOptions.perStepTimeoutMs`, the warning lands in `ApplyResult.warnings` and the XCTAssert on that fixture fails with the named step in the message.

### 7. Order of implementation (commit boundaries)

Eight commits, each leaving the tree green:

1. **Add `Sources/WorkspaceApplyPlan.swift`** with value types only. Add `WorkspaceApplyPlanCodableTests.swift` with round-trip Codable tests (including `mailbox.*` keys). No executor yet. Tree builds; tests pass in CI.
2. **Extract `Workspace.paneIdForPanel(_:)` helper** (refactor of the inline loop in `newTerminalSplit`/`newBrowserSplit`/`newMarkdownSplit` at `Sources/Workspace.swift:7215-7223` and siblings). No behavior change. One-line callers update.
3. **Add `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift` skeleton** — signature + step 1 validation + step 2 workspace creation + step 3 workspace metadata. Returns a stub `ApplyResult` with only workspace-level fields populated. `paneRefs`/`surfaceRefs` empty.
4. **Implement layout walker (steps 4-5)** — seed-panel handoff, DFS traversal, split primitives, in-pane surface creation. Still no metadata writes at surface level.
5. **Implement metadata writes (step 6)** — surface + pane, including the `mailbox.*` string-value guard.
6. **Implement terminal initial command + refs assembly (steps 7-8)** — `sendText` for terminals + `surfaceRefs`/`paneRefs` minting. `ApplyResult` fully populated.
7. **Add TODO comments to welcome-quad and default-grid** (section 5). Two-file change, documentation only.
8. **Add acceptance fixture + 5 JSON plans** (`c11Tests/WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift` + `c11Tests/Fixtures/workspace-apply-plans/*.json`). Optional commit 8b: add `case "workspace.apply":` v2 handler in `TerminalController.swift` + minimal `c11 workspace apply --file` CLI wiring in `CLI/c11.swift`. This is the observable socket surface; can slip to Phase 1 without breaking the executor.

Each commit carries the `CMUX-37 Phase 0:` prefix and references the specific deliverable from the plan file. Per the global policy in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, push on clean forward motion; open PR once commit 8 (or 8b) lands.

### 8. Alignment with C11-13

**Locked contract reaffirmed.** The executor addresses surfaces by **surface name** (via `SurfaceSpec.title` → `panelCustomTitles` → `SurfaceMetadataStore["title"]`), never by the process-local `surface:N` ref. Plan-local `SurfaceSpec.id` is a temporary handle used only during `apply()` and never persisted beyond `ApplyResult`. The `mailbox.*` namespace round-trips through `SurfaceSpec.paneMetadata` unmodified; the executor's only contribution is the strings-only type guard (alignment doc `:49-55`). `c11 mailbox configure` (C11-13's CLI) remains a separate runtime mutation path through the existing `set_metadata` socket method — **not** routed through `workspace.apply`. The executor is a creation primitive; C11-13's CLI is a post-creation mutation primitive. They share the store and the namespace, not the code path. This stays true through all of Phase 0 and does not change in later phases.

### 9. Risks / open questions

1. **Seed-panel replacement for non-terminal root leaves (step 4).** `TabManager.addWorkspace` always mints a `TerminalPanel` for the root pane (`TabManager.swift:1158-1166`). If `plan.layout` roots with a `LayoutTreeSpec.pane` whose first surface is `browser` or `markdown`, the executor must either (a) close the seed terminal and open the target kind in the same pane, or (b) add a `TabManager.addWorkspaceWithoutSeed` path. **Recommendation:** (a) in Phase 0 — simpler, no TabManager change, one extra panel mint+close per workspace. **Needs_human trigger:** only if operator wants to avoid the visible flash of the seed terminal; if so, (b) is a small TabManager change. Default to (a); reconsider if the acceptance fixture shows a visible flash.
2. **`dividerPosition` API surface.** Phase 0 plan mentions applying `split.dividerPosition` but bonsplit's divider-position setter is not yet cited in this plan. If `bonsplitController` exposes `setDividerPosition(paneId:position:)` (or equivalent), wire it; if not, Phase 0 accepts the default 50/50 and files a follow-up. **Not a blocker** — Phase 1 Snapshot restore will need it, at which point the gap is obvious.
3. **Focus behavior.** `ApplyOptions.select` defaults true so the debug CLI matches `workspace.create`. The **socket focus policy** in `CLAUDE.md` forbids non-focus-intent commands from stealing focus. `workspace.apply` is *intent-bearing* (it created the workspace), so selecting is consistent with `workspace.create`. All internal split calls pass `focus: false` and `autoWelcomeIfNeeded: false` to avoid compounding focus moves. **No human decision needed unless the Impl agent observes focus thrash during the acceptance run.**
4. **Typing-latency hot paths untouched.** `TerminalWindowPortal.hitTest()`, `TabItemView`, and `GhosttyTerminalView.forceRefresh()` are not on the executor's write path. The executor invokes existing split primitives that already respect these invariants; no new allocation or observation is added inside their bodies. This is a confirmation, not a risk — flagged explicitly because the Impl agent might be tempted to add timing breadcrumbs inside one of those paths. **Don't.** Breadcrumbs live in the executor, not inside split primitives or terminal-refresh hot loops.
5. **`c11 install <tui>` and wrapper generalization — NOT proposed.** Per `CLAUDE.md` c11-is-unopinionated-about-the-terminal principle, Phase 0 does not touch `Resources/bin/claude`, does not add per-agent wrappers, and does not write to any tenant config. `WorkspaceApplyPlan` is app-internal; the debug CLI `c11 workspace apply --file` reads from a path the operator supplies.
6. **Socket method + CLI in Phase 0 or Phase 1?** The broader plan (`:137`) lists `workspace.apply` as Phase 0. The prompt's concrete deliverable list focuses on the executor and fixture. **Recommendation:** ship the socket handler + minimal CLI (`commit 8b` above); they total ~50 LOC and give the executor an observable surface for CI or operator debugging without enlarging Phase 0 scope. If Impl time is tight, defer to Phase 1 — the acceptance fixture runs the executor directly and doesn't need the socket. **No human decision needed unless Impl pushes back.**
7. **`Workspace.setOperatorMetadata` helper — exists or new?** The plan assumes workspace-level metadata has a setter; if it's currently only written through the `SessionWorkspaceSnapshot` restore path, Impl adds a one-line helper that mirrors `setPanelCustomTitle`'s shape. **Not a blocker** — small localized change.
8. **`TabManager.workspaceRef(for:)` helper — exists or new?** Ref minting for `workspace:N` is owned by the v2 handler layer today (`TerminalController.swift:2066`). Impl should reuse that helper rather than duplicating the logic in the executor. If the helper lives inside `TerminalController`, lift it to `TabManager` or a small `V2Refs` namespace so the executor doesn't depend on the socket layer. **Not a blocker** — trivial refactor.

None of the open questions rise to a `needs_human` architectural fork. They are execution-detail calls Impl can make in-session with reasonable defaults captured above.

## Review Cycle 1 Findings (2026-04-24)

*Verdict:* **FAIL-IMPL-REWORK** from `/trident-code-review` (9-agent pack; 3-model consensus on both blockers). Same branch, no plan reshape. Scope: ~1 day walker + harness rework, ~½ day for the accompanying minor-fixes. Cycle 1 of max 3.

*Review pack:* `notes/trident-review-CMUX-37-pack-20260424-0303/` (12 files: 9 per-agent + 3 synthesis).

*What's clean (consensus — do not change):* value types + Codable round-trips; `PersistedJSONValue` reuse; `source: .explicit` throughout; `mailbox.*` strings-only guard; reserved-key routing through `setPanelCustomTitle` / canonical `setMetadata`; no typing-latency hot-path edits; no terminal-opinion creep (no `Resources/bin/claude` touch, no `c11 install <tui>`); `async` drop is clean (no trailing awaits, no spurious `Task { }` in the socket handler); 8-commit boundary hygiene; TODO comments at welcome-quad / default-grid migration sites.

### BLOCKERS (must fix to pass cycle 2)

**B1. Layout walker composes nested splits bottom-up against a leaf-only API.** `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.materializeSplit` (`Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift:448-501`) splits a leaf of `split.first` to produce what should be a sibling of the whole `split.first` subtree, but bonsplit's `splitPane(_:orientation:insertFirst:)` only splits leaf panes. 4 of 5 acceptance fixtures materialize malformed trees (welcome-quad, default-grid, mixed-browser-markdown, deep-nested-splits); only `single-large-with-metadata` (no splits) escapes. This is a design-level defect — not a line edit. **Fix path:** top-down injection matching `Workspace.restoreSessionLayoutNode` (the existing idiom the `SessionWorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` restore path already uses), or outer-first two-pass preallocation. Trace-validate the new walker against welcome-quad and default-grid shapes before landing.

**B2. Acceptance harness cannot detect B1.** `c11Tests/WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift:106-147` asserts only ref-set membership + the 2_000 ms timing. No bonsplit tree-shape comparison, no divider-position check, no `selectedIndex` check, no per-fixture metadata round-trip beyond `single-large-with-metadata`. Section 6 of the plan called for structural-fingerprint assertions — they were not shipped, which is why B1 passed CI silently. **Fix path:** add structural assertions to `runFixture` that normalize `workspace.bonsplitController.treeSnapshot()` (orientation + recursive pane grouping + leaf surface-id order + divider positions + `selectedIndex`) and compare against the plan's `LayoutTreeSpec`. Extend the metadata round-trip pattern from `single-large-with-metadata` to every fixture. **Land the test first, watch all 5 fail, then ship the walker fix** — this is the TDD anchor for B1.

### IMPORTANT (fix in the same rework pass)

**I1. `SurfaceSpec.workingDirectory` silently dropped for split-created terminals and the reused seed.** At `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift:361` (seed-reuse path) and `:506-537` (split path), `newTerminalSplit` has no `cwd` parameter and no `ApplyFailure` is emitted when `workingDirectory` is non-nil. Silent data loss. **Fix path:** either plumb `cwd` through `Workspace.newTerminalSplit` / `newTerminalSurface(inPane:)` / seed-reuse, or emit `ApplyFailure("working_directory_not_applied", step: ..., message: "…")` when `workingDirectory` is set and the creation path doesn't support it. First option preferred since the single-pane path already honors `workspace.workingDirectory` via `TabManager.addWorkspace`.

**I2. CLI subcommand name drift.** Impl shipped `c11 workspace-apply` at `CLI/c11.swift:1713`, but the CMUX-37 plan body (`:83`) and `docs/c11-snapshot-restore-plan.md:164` both specify `c11 workspace apply` (subcommand under `workspace`). **Fix path:** add a `c11 workspace apply` subcommand route at `CLI/c11.swift:1713` (or equivalent subcommand dispatch point) to match plan and docs. Keeping `c11 workspace-apply` as a back-compat alias is acceptable but not required — nothing else consumes it yet.

**I3. `validate(plan:)` runs on MainActor inside `v2MainSync`, contradicting the handler header's off-main promise.** `Sources/TerminalController.swift:4347-4399` + `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift:63-64`. The socket-command threading policy in `CLAUDE.md` requires parse/validate off-main, with only AppKit/model mutation on main. **Fix path:** hoist the `validate(plan:)` call (and any pure decode/arg-parsing) above the `v2MainSync { … }` block in `v2WorkspaceApply` so the handler comment becomes true. Only the `apply(_:options:)` body needs the MainActor.

**I4. Silent-failure gaps (close in the same pass).**
  - **I4a.** `ApplyOptions.perStepTimeoutMs` is not enforced (Codex finding). The option exists on the struct but nothing inside the executor reads it. **Fix path:** wrap each step's timing measurement with the deadline check; on breach, append a warning with the step name and keep going (soft limit, per the plan's partial-failure semantics).
  - **I4b.** `WorkspaceApplyPlan.version` is not validated (Codex finding). Version-1 plans should be accepted; anything else should short-circuit with a typed error before any workspace is created.
  - **I4c.** `applyDividerPositions` does not emit `ApplyFailure` on tree-shape mismatch (Gemini finding). When the plan's `SplitSpec.dividerPosition` references a split slot that doesn't exist in the live bonsplit tree (because of B1 or a future divergence), it currently no-ops silently. **Fix path:** emit `ApplyFailure("divider_apply_failed", step: "layout.split[<i>].divider", message: ...)` and continue.
  - **I4d.** `validateLayout` does not detect duplicate `surfaceIds` references in `PaneSpec.surfaceIds` or across multiple `PaneSpec`s (Gemini finding). Two leaves referencing the same plan-local surface id produce undefined behavior. **Fix path:** add a duplicate-reference check to step 1 validation; emit a typed error and short-circuit before any workspace is created.

**I5. Plan file — sync the `async` signature with what shipped.** `.lattice/plans/task_01KPMTEY4WGECM9MNZ4XARN7Y6.md:58` still reads `async @MainActor func apply(…)`. Impl shipped sync because Phase 0 has no await points (verified clean by review). Update the plan sketch to match so Phase 1 agents implementing the readiness pass see the correct current shape. This is a documentation-only plan edit; it does NOT change the rework scope.

### Rework directive — order of work

Ship as a continuation of the same feature branch (`cmux-37/phase-0-workspace-apply-plan`). Commits carry the `CMUX-37 Phase 0 (rework):` prefix.

1. **Commit R1 — structural-assertion harness (lands first).** Rewrite `c11Tests/WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift:runFixture` to normalize `bonsplitController.treeSnapshot()` and compare against the plan `LayoutTreeSpec`. Extend metadata round-trip to every fixture. Push. CI should fail all 5 fixtures (expected — this is the TDD anchor).
2. **Commit R2 — walker top-down rewrite.** Replace `materializeSplit` with a top-down injection / outer-first two-pass strategy modeled on `Workspace.restoreSessionLayoutNode`. Trace-validate welcome-quad + default-grid shapes in-source before pushing. CI now passes all 5 fixtures.
3. **Commit R3 — plumb `SurfaceSpec.workingDirectory`.** Either through split primitives or via `ApplyFailure` emission when unsupported. Add a fixture that exercises `workingDirectory` on a split-created terminal.
4. **Commit R4 — CLI subcommand rename.** Add `c11 workspace apply` route. Alias retained or removed per Impl judgment.
5. **Commit R5 — off-main validate.** Hoist `validate(plan:)` above `v2MainSync` in `v2WorkspaceApply`.
6. **Commit R6 — silent-failure gaps.** I4a (`perStepTimeoutMs` enforcement), I4b (`version` validation), I4c (`divider_apply_failed` warning), I4d (duplicate-ref check). Extend existing Codable/validation tests with cases for each.
7. **Commit R7 — plan file sync.** Edit `.lattice/plans/task_01KPMTEY4WGECM9MNZ4XARN7Y6.md:58` to match the shipped sync signature. One-line documentation edit.

After R7 lands and is pushed, the rework Impl agent posts the completion comment on CMUX-37 and the delegator spawns Trident cycle 2 on the new branch head.

## Historical (shipped) — Phase 1 Implementation Plan (2026-04-24)

> Shipped via PR #79 (dab51bd2, 2026-04-26) along with Phases 2–5. Kept for context; do not redo.



*Agent:* `agent:claude-opus-4-7-cmux-37-p1-plan`. Scope is **Snapshot capture + file format, Snapshot restore, `c11 snapshot` / `c11 restore` / `c11 list-snapshots`, and Claude session resume (cc-only)**. No Blueprints, no picker, no `--all`, no codex/kimi/opencode registry rows. Terminal surfaces are the primary target, but the snapshot file faithfully carries browser/markdown kinds too so Phase 3's `--all` + non-terminal work is a schema extension (new fields), not a format break. Built entirely on top of Phase 0's shipped `WorkspaceApplyPlan` / `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor`.

### Design decisions (picked before the file list)

1. **Snapshot wire format: wrap `WorkspaceApplyPlan`, don't extend it.** New `WorkspaceSnapshotFile` envelope that *embeds* a `WorkspaceApplyPlan` alongside snapshot-scoped metadata (`snapshot_id`, `created_at`, `c11_version`, `origin`). Rationale: Phase 0's `WorkspaceApplyPlan` is the shared primitive for Blueprints (Phase 2) *and* Snapshots — adding `snapshot_id` / timestamps to the plan type itself would contaminate Blueprint authoring (why does my checked-in markdown layout carry `snapshot_id`?) and force every future plan consumer to ignore fields it doesn't care about. Wrapping keeps the plan type pure. Phase 1's on-disk JSON is `{version, snapshot_id, created_at, c11_version, origin, plan: <WorkspaceApplyPlan>}` — one level of nesting, obvious separation.
2. **Reuse, don't extend, `SessionPersistence.swift`'s snapshot types.** Phase 0's plan already mirrors `SessionWorkspaceLayoutSnapshot` structurally; converting one to the other is a ~30-line translator inside the capture path. Reusing the session types would force the converter to keep two parallel type families in sync forever (and would couple the snapshot file to Tier 1's autosave format, which can change independently). `WorkspaceSnapshotFile` stays thin; the plan inside is exactly what the executor takes. No churn to `SessionPersistence.swift`.
3. **Storage: `~/.c11-snapshots/<ulid>.json`.** The rename from `cmux` → `c11` is the one-way door; aligning fresh directories with the new name keeps future grep-ability honest. Backwards-compat read of `~/.cmux-snapshots/` (if it exists) is added so operators who piloted an earlier iteration don't lose files. Writes always go to `~/.c11-snapshots/`. `c11 list-snapshots` merges both locations for discovery, with a `source:` column when listing from the legacy directory.
4. **Session-id metadata key: `claude.session_id` on *surface* metadata.** Pairs with the canonical `terminal_type` key that `SurfaceMetadataStore.reservedKeys` already recognizes (`Sources/SurfaceMetadataStore.swift:143-152`) and that `c11 set-agent --type claude-code` already writes. A pane can host multiple tab-stacked surfaces; each Claude Code surface has its own session. Per-surface is the right granularity. The `claude.*` prefix is reserved in the alignment doc (`docs/c11-13-cmux-37-alignment.md:34`) for the restart registry and does not collide with C11-13's `mailbox.*` (pane-layer) namespace.
5. **Opt-in gate (`C11_SESSION_RESUME=1`): applied at *restore* time only.** Capture always writes `claude.session_id` to surface metadata because the SessionStart hook does that continuously regardless of flags — the metadata is data, not policy. Only synthesis of `cc --resume <id>` is gated. The env var is read once at the top of `c11 restore`'s command handler (CLI layer) and threads through to the executor as `ApplyOptions.restartRegistry = .phase1` (vs. `nil`). This way an operator disabling resume still gets their layout back, just with fresh `cc` shells instead of resumed ones — and snapshots written while the flag is off still contain the session ids for later use.
6. **Executor integration for restart: new `ApplyOptions.restartRegistry: AgentRestartRegistry?` (default `nil`).** When non-nil and a `SurfaceSpec.command` is `nil` on a terminal surface, the executor consults the registry with `(terminal_type, session_id, surface.metadata)` and, if the registry returns a command, uses that for `TerminalPanel.sendText`. Explicit `SurfaceSpec.command` always wins (no synthesis). Default `nil` preserves Phase 0 behavior bit-exactly for the debug `c11 workspace apply` path and all existing acceptance fixtures. Nothing in Phase 0's `ApplyResult` shape changes; the new field is additive and Codable-optional.
7. **Converter purity: a pure file, pure function, no AppKit, no stores, no env reads.** The env gate is resolved at the CLI layer. The converter's job is shape-only: take a loaded `WorkspaceSnapshotFile`, produce a `WorkspaceApplyPlan`. Restart-registry synthesis is NOT done in the converter — it happens in the executor, at the creation-time seam, so Blueprints (Phase 2) also benefit without a second copy of the logic.
8. **Capture seam: `WorkspaceSnapshotSource` protocol.** `LiveWorkspaceSnapshotSource` walks `TabManager` + `Workspace.bonsplitController.treeSnapshot()` + `SurfaceMetadataStore` + `PaneMetadataStore`. Tests use a `FakeWorkspaceSnapshotSource` that returns canned snapshots without touching AppKit. Same pattern Phase 0 applied for `WorkspaceLayoutExecutorDependencies`.
9. **`cmux` compat is automatic.** The `cmux` binary name (shipped as a copy/hardlink of `c11` today — see `CLI/c11.swift:33` "binary rename" note and `mirrorC11CmuxEnv()`) dispatches through the same `main.swift` entry point and subcommand switch. `cmux snapshot`, `cmux restore`, `cmux list-snapshots` work for free once the switch arms exist. No separate wiring; we only verify the help text includes the aliases (plan notes below).

### Files to add

- `Sources/WorkspaceSnapshot.swift` — the `WorkspaceSnapshotFile` envelope (`Codable, Sendable, Equatable`) with `version: Int`, `snapshotId: String` (ULID), `createdAt: Date`, `c11Version: String`, `origin: Origin` (enum: `.manual`, `.autoRestart`), `plan: WorkspaceApplyPlan`. No behavior. ~80 LOC including Codable boilerplate. Lives adjacent to `Sources/WorkspaceApplyPlan.swift` for symmetry.
- `Sources/WorkspaceSnapshotCapture.swift` — the `WorkspaceSnapshotSource` protocol, `LiveWorkspaceSnapshotSource: WorkspaceSnapshotSource` implementation, and the `captureWorkspace(_: Workspace) -> WorkspaceSnapshotFile` walk. The walker produces a `WorkspaceApplyPlan` by translating the live bonsplit tree (`Workspace.bonsplitController.treeSnapshot()`) into `LayoutTreeSpec`, each leaf panel into a `SurfaceSpec`, reading surface metadata (`SurfaceMetadataStore.shared.getMetadata`) and pane metadata (`PaneMetadataStore.shared.getMetadata`). Runs `@MainActor` — capture needs a consistent snapshot of AppKit state. ~300 LOC.
- `Sources/WorkspaceSnapshotConverter.swift` — the pure converter. `enum WorkspaceSnapshotConverter` with a single `nonisolated static func applyPlan(from snapshot: WorkspaceSnapshotFile) -> Result<WorkspaceApplyPlan, ConverterError>`. No AppKit, no stores, no file I/O, no env reads. Also houses `enum ConverterError` (version mismatch, corrupt envelope). ~80 LOC.
- `Sources/WorkspaceSnapshotStore.swift` — filesystem I/O: `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.write(_:to:)`, `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.read(from:)`, `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.list() -> [WorkspaceSnapshotIndex]`, `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.defaultDirectory() -> URL` (resolves `~/.c11-snapshots/`), `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.legacyDirectory() -> URL` (resolves `~/.cmux-snapshots/`). Atomic writes. ULID-named files. Also defines the small `WorkspaceSnapshotIndex` record used by `list-snapshots` (id, created_at, workspace-title-hint, surface-count, origin). ~180 LOC. Tests go through a public `directoryOverride:` init for isolation from the real home dir.
- `Sources/AgentRestartRegistry.swift` — pure value type. Shape:
  ```swift
  struct AgentRestartRegistry: Sendable {
      struct Row: Sendable {
          let terminalType: String
          /// Returns the command string, or nil if the row declines (e.g., missing session id with no fallback).
          let resolve: @Sendable (_ sessionId: String?, _ metadata: [String: String]) -> String?
      }
      private let rowsByType: [String: Row]
      init(rows: [Row])
      func resolveCommand(terminalType: String?, sessionId: String?, metadata: [String: String]) -> String?
      static let phase1: AgentRestartRegistry = .init(rows: [
          Row(terminalType: "claude-code") { sessionId, _ in
              guard let id = sessionId?.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines), !id.isEmpty else { return nil }
              return "cc --resume \(id)"
          }
      ])
  }
  ```
  Phase 5 adds rows for `codex` / `opencode` / `kimi` inside this same file without schema changes. ~70 LOC.
- `c11Tests/WorkspaceSnapshotConverterTests.swift` — pure Codable + converter tests. Round-trip a `WorkspaceSnapshotFile` through `JSONEncoder` / `JSONDecoder`; pass the loaded snapshot through `WorkspaceSnapshotConverter.applyPlan` and assert the resulting `WorkspaceApplyPlan` matches the expected shape. Fixtures include: one terminal with `claude.session_id` + `terminal_type=claude-code`; one with `mailbox.*` pane-metadata keys; one mixed terminal + browser + markdown. No AppKit. Lives in the existing `c11Tests` target (same target membership as `WorkspaceApplyPlanCodableTests.swift`).
- `c11Tests/AgentRestartRegistryTests.swift` — pure tests for the registry. Cases: claude-code with session id → `"cc --resume <id>"`; claude-code without session id → `nil`; unknown terminal_type → `nil`; empty session id whitespace → `nil`; explicit command path short-circuits (exercised at the executor seam, but a direct registry test for the resolver closure lives here). ~60 LOC.
- `c11Tests/WorkspaceSnapshotCaptureTests.swift` — seam-level tests using a `FakeWorkspaceSnapshotSource` that returns a canned `WorkspaceSnapshotFile`. Validates the capture→write→read→convert→apply loop for a small fixture, asserts round-trip through `WorkspaceSnapshotStore`. No `@MainActor` needed for the fake path.
- `c11Tests/WorkspaceSnapshotRoundTripAcceptanceTests.swift` — the end-to-end acceptance fixture (see *Acceptance fixture* section below). Runs against a real `TabManager` + `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor`, same CI-only pattern as Phase 0's `WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift`. Triggers via `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml` with a test-filter arg.
- `c11Tests/Fixtures/workspace-snapshots/mixed-claude-mailbox.json` — the acceptance fixture: one workspace, one terminal with `claude.session_id` + `terminal_type=claude-code` + `mailbox.delivery="stdin,watch"` + `mailbox.subscribe="build.*"`, one browser with a stable local-file URL (data URL to avoid network), one markdown tab-stacked on the terminal, one additional terminal split right with a fresh `claude-code` / session id. Human-readable; doubles as a documentation artifact.
- `skills/c11/references/claude-resume.md` — new reference doc. Covers: what Claude Code SessionStart delivers on stdin (`session_id`, `cwd`, transcript path); the `~/.claude/settings.json` SessionStart hook snippet operators add manually (exact content reproduces the SessionStart entry from `CLI/c11.swift:13642-13648`); how `c11 claude-hook session-start` maps `session_id` → surface metadata `claude.session_id` via the socket; the `C11_SESSION_RESUME=1` env flag; cross-reference to the grandfathered `Resources/bin/claude` wrapper as "the in-c11 path, not a pattern to extend" per CLAUDE.md. Note explicitly that **c11 never writes to `~/.claude/settings.json`** — the operator copy-pastes the snippet themselves or runs their own config management. ~80 lines of markdown.

### Files to edit

- `CLI/c11.swift` — add three top-level switch arms next to `case "workspace":` at line **1736**:
  - `case "snapshot":` — `c11 snapshot [--workspace <ref>] [--out <path>]`. Default scope is the caller's current workspace; `--workspace` overrides. `--out` overrides the default `~/.c11-snapshots/<ulid>.json` path. Runs via `snapshot.create` v2 socket method (see socket-method section below). Prints the resulting snapshot path (or JSON `{snapshot_id, path}` under `--json`).
  - `case "restore":` — `c11 restore <snapshot-id-or-path> [--select]`. Accepts either an id that resolves inside `~/.c11-snapshots/` (+ legacy fallback) or an absolute path. Reads `C11_SESSION_RESUME` env at this site only; threads resolved `restartRegistry` into `snapshot.restore` v2 params. Prints the new `workspace_ref` + per-surface refs, same shape as `workspace apply`.
  - `case "list-snapshots":` — `c11 list-snapshots [--json]`. Merges `~/.c11-snapshots/` + `~/.cmux-snapshots/` (marking legacy entries). Columns: `SNAPSHOT_ID`, `CREATED_AT`, `WORKSPACE_TITLE`, `SURFACES`, `ORIGIN`, `SOURCE`. The help text listing at `CLI/c11.swift:1441+` gets a one-line entry for each command.
- `CLI/c11.swift:12332-12369` — augment the existing `case "session-start", "active":` handler. After the existing `sessionStore.upsert(...)` call at line **12351** (which persists to `~/.cmuxterm/claude-hook-sessions.json`), add a second best-effort write: a `client.sendV2(method: "surface.set_metadata", params: {...})` call that merges `{"claude.session_id": <id>}` with `source: "explicit"` (the operator-hook is the operator's voice, so `.explicit` is correct; `.declare` would not persist past a higher-precedence write) onto the resolved `surfaceId`. Wrap in `do {...} catch let error as CLIError where isAdvisoryHookConnectivityError(error) {...}` so a missing socket (Claude running outside a c11 surface) doesn't error the hook. Telemetry breadcrumb: `"claude-hook.session-id.metadata-write.{ok,skipped,failed}"`. No new symbols; reuses the in-scope `client` and `surfaceId` bindings. ~25 LOC of additions.
- `CLI/c11.swift:2620-2672` — near `runWorkspaceApply(...)`, add `runSnapshotCreate`, `runSnapshotRestore`, `runListSnapshots` helpers. Each is ~40-60 LOC, mirrors the existing `runWorkspaceApply` pattern: parse flags → build params → `client.sendV2(method: ..., params:)` → format output. `runSnapshotRestore` reads `C11_SESSION_RESUME` via `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["C11_SESSION_RESUME"]` (the `CMUX_*` mirror via `mirrorC11CmuxEnv()` makes `CMUX_SESSION_RESUME` work identically) and includes `{"restart_registry": "phase1"}` or similar in params; the app-side handler resolves the named registry.
- `Sources/TerminalController.swift` near line **2105** (`case "workspace.apply":`) — add two more v2 method arms:
  - `case "snapshot.create":` → `v2SnapshotCreate(params:)`. Off-main decode, resolve the target `Workspace` on `v2MainSync`, invoke `LiveWorkspaceSnapshotSource.capture(...)`, write through `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.write`, return `{snapshot_id, path, surface_count, workspace_ref}`.
  - `case "snapshot.restore":` → `v2SnapshotRestore(params:)`. Off-main read + decode + converter pass (converter is `nonisolated`, validated off-main like `validate(plan:)` at line **4386**), then `v2MainSync` around the executor call. Registry threading: params may carry `"restart_registry": "phase1"`; the handler maps the string to `AgentRestartRegistry.phase1` (named-registry lookup keeps the wire format stringly-typed and forward-compatible). Returns the same `ApplyResult` shape `workspace.apply` returns.
  - `case "snapshot.list":` → returns `[WorkspaceSnapshotIndex]` serialized as an array of dicts. Pure file-listing; runs off-main entirely.
- `Sources/WorkspaceApplyPlan.swift` — extend `ApplyOptions` with one new field: `var restartRegistry: AgentRestartRegistry? = nil`. Codable-optional; absent in JSON = nil = Phase 0 behavior unchanged. Update the field's doc comment to cite its purpose. Also extend the `ApplyFailure.code` comment with `"restart_registry_declined"` (when the registry was consulted but returned nil) for observability.
- `Sources/WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.swift` — insert the restart-registry guard in step 7 (terminal initial commands), lines **182-196**. The current loop reads `surfaceSpec.command`; replace with a computed `effectiveCommand`:
  ```swift
  let explicitCommand = surfaceSpec.command?.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
  let effectiveCommand: String?
  if let explicit = explicitCommand, !explicit.isEmpty {
      effectiveCommand = explicit
  } else if let registry = options.restartRegistry {
      let surfaceMeta = stringMetadata(surfaceSpec.metadata)   // decode only string-valued PersistedJSONValues
      let terminalType = surfaceMeta["terminal_type"]
      let sessionId = surfaceMeta["claude.session_id"]
      effectiveCommand = registry.resolveCommand(
          terminalType: terminalType,
          sessionId: sessionId,
          metadata: surfaceMeta
      )
      if effectiveCommand == nil, terminalType != nil || sessionId != nil {
          // Registry saw inputs but declined — make it visible.
          failures.append(ApplyFailure(
              code: "restart_registry_declined",
              step: "surface[\(surfaceSpec.id)].command.resolve",
              message: "restart registry declined for terminal_type=\(terminalType ?? "nil") sessionId=\(sessionId?.prefix(8).description ?? "nil")"
          ))
      }
  } else {
      effectiveCommand = nil
  }
  guard let cmd = effectiveCommand, !cmd.isEmpty, …
  ```
  `stringMetadata` is a new `fileprivate` helper that flattens `[String: PersistedJSONValue]?` to `[String: String]` (only `.string(...)` entries, others are skipped). Explicit `SurfaceSpec.command` wins over the registry unconditionally. Add this to the step-7 comment block; ~35 LOC including the helper.
- `Sources/WorkspaceMetadataKeys.swift` — add `public static let claudeSessionId = "claude.session_id"` and (for symmetry) `public static let terminalTypeClaudeCode = "claude-code"` constants next to the existing ones. The executor and capture walker reference these constants rather than string-literal the keys. Keeps the spelling in one place; makes a future rename grep-tractable.
- `skills/c11/SKILL.md` — three additions:
  1. In the *References* section (near `skills/c11/SKILL.md:458+`), add a line `**[references/claude-resume.md](references/claude-resume.md)** — Claude session resume: operator-installed SessionStart hook and the `C11_SESSION_RESUME` gate`.
  2. New short *Workspace persistence* section (~20 lines) immediately before *References*, covering `c11 snapshot` / `c11 restore` / `c11 list-snapshots` with 2 example invocations and a pointer to the reference doc for the resume semantics.
  3. Under *Declaring your agent (details)* (line **~125**), add one line after the `c11 set-agent` examples: `> When inside Claude Code, `claude.session_id` is populated automatically by the `c11 claude-hook session-start` handler — no agent action required.`
- `docs/c11-snapshot-restore-plan.md` — note Phase 1 ship status in the header table at the top once Impl completes (one-line edit, non-blocking). Out-of-scope for the plan Impl agent; delegator handles on close-out.

**Invariants the capture walker must honour:**
- Surface `title` is the exact `setPanelCustomTitle` value (`Workspace.swift:5854`) at capture time. Round-trips byte-exact. Surface-name addressing (mailbox, etc.) depends on this.
- `mailbox.*` pane-metadata keys are copied into `paneMetadata` unmodified, strings-only. The capture walker does not read through, does not decode, does not rewrite keys or values. It uses `PaneMetadataStore.shared.getMetadata(workspaceId:paneId:)`.
- `claude.session_id` lives on *surface* metadata (not pane). Pane metadata reserves `mailbox.*`; surface metadata reserves the canonical-keys set + `claude.*` / `codex.*` / `opencode.*` restart-registry prefixes (alignment doc `:34`).
- `ApplyResult`-local UUIDs (live refs) are never persisted. Plan-local `SurfaceSpec.id` values are re-minted at capture time (e.g. `"s1"`, `"s2"`, …) and exist only within a single snapshot file's lifetime.

### Converter purity / test harness

**Pure file:** `Sources/WorkspaceSnapshotConverter.swift`. No imports beyond `Foundation`.

**Pure function:**
```swift
enum WorkspaceSnapshotConverter {
    /// Pure conversion from a loaded snapshot envelope to a plan the
    /// executor can apply. Does NOT materialize the restart-registry
    /// command — that happens at apply time inside the executor so
    /// Blueprints get the same behavior without duplicate logic. Does
    /// NOT read env vars, touch stores, or hit AppKit.
    nonisolated static func applyPlan(
        from snapshot: WorkspaceSnapshotFile
    ) -> Result<WorkspaceApplyPlan, ConverterError>
}
```

**Inputs:** `WorkspaceSnapshotFile` (Codable value). **Outputs:** `WorkspaceApplyPlan` (Phase 0's shipped type) or a `ConverterError` (`versionUnsupported`, `planVersionUnsupported` — delegates to `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.supportedPlanVersions`, `planDecodeFailed`).

**Test file:** `c11Tests/WorkspaceSnapshotConverterTests.swift`. Fixture-driven. Each test is `XCTestCase` method that loads a JSON file from `c11Tests/Fixtures/workspace-snapshots/`, decodes, passes through the converter, asserts the `WorkspaceApplyPlan` structure. Matrix:
- `minimal-single-terminal.json` — one terminal, no agent metadata.
- `claude-code-with-session.json` — one terminal with `claude.session_id` + `terminal_type=claude-code`, no `command`. Converter output has `surfaces[0].command == nil` (the registry runs in the executor, not here).
- `mailbox-roundtrip.json` — three `mailbox.*` pane-metadata keys. Asserts every key + value round-trips byte-for-byte through the converter.
- `mixed-surfaces.json` — terminal + browser + markdown, nested split. Asserts layout tree shape is preserved.
- `version-mismatch.json` — `"version": 999`. Asserts `.failure(.versionUnsupported(999))`.

All tests are `@MainActor`-free. Runs in the existing `c11Tests` target alongside `WorkspaceApplyPlanCodableTests.swift`.

### Restart registry shape

```swift
// Sources/AgentRestartRegistry.swift

/// Pure-value lookup table mapping a known terminal type + session hint to
/// the shell command that resumes it. Phase 1 ships a single row for
/// `claude-code`; rows for `codex`, `opencode`, `kimi` land in Phase 5
/// without schema changes.
struct AgentRestartRegistry: Sendable {
    struct Row: Sendable {
        /// Canonical terminal_type string, matching the value written by
        /// `c11 set-agent --type <type>` and surfaced by the sidebar chip.
        let terminalType: String
        /// Pure resolver. Returns the command to run, or `nil` to decline
        /// (e.g., required session id missing). Metadata is the full
        /// string-valued surface-metadata map; future rows may consult
        /// additional keys without schema changes.
        let resolve: @Sendable (_ sessionId: String?, _ metadata: [String: String]) -> String?
    }

    private let rowsByType: [String: Row]

    init(rows: [Row]) {
        var map: [String: Row] = [:]
        for row in rows { map[row.terminalType] = row }
        self.rowsByType = map
    }

    /// Consult the registry. Returns nil when the type is unknown or the
    /// matching row declines.
    func resolveCommand(
        terminalType: String?,
        sessionId: String?,
        metadata: [String: String]
    ) -> String? {
        guard let type = terminalType?.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines),
              !type.isEmpty,
              let row = rowsByType[type] else { return nil }
        return row.resolve(sessionId, metadata)
    }

    /// Phase 1 ships cc resume only. Phase 5 adds codex / opencode / kimi
    /// rows here; adding a row is a one-line append to this literal.
    static let phase1: AgentRestartRegistry = .init(rows: [
        Row(terminalType: "claude-code") { sessionId, _ in
            guard let id = sessionId?.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines),
                  !id.isEmpty else { return nil }
            return "cc --resume \(id)"
        }
    ])
}
```

The registry is **not Codable**. It flows through `ApplyOptions.restartRegistry` as an in-process reference and is resolved by name at the v2 handler boundary (`"phase1"` → `.phase1`). Keeping it out of the wire format prevents snapshot files from locking in a specific registry version — a snapshot written today stays restorable after Phase 5 adds rows, because the registry is resolved app-side at restore time.

### Acceptance fixture

**Scenario:** a single mixed-surface workspace captured and restored round-trip.

**Shape:** workspace `"CMUX-37 acceptance"` at horizontal split. Left pane: two tab-stacked surfaces — one terminal with `terminal_type=claude-code` + `claude.session_id=<fixed-uuid>` + pane-metadata `mailbox.delivery=stdin` and `mailbox.subscribe=build.*`, one markdown (file path pointing to an existing repo markdown file to keep the test deterministic). Right pane: one terminal with a different `claude.session_id` and `mailbox.retention_days=14`, plus one browser surface split below it.

**Location:** `c11Tests/WorkspaceSnapshotRoundTripAcceptanceTests.swift` + `c11Tests/Fixtures/workspace-snapshots/mixed-claude-mailbox.json`.

**Flow:**
1. Load `mixed-claude-mailbox.json` as a seed `WorkspaceApplyPlan`, apply via `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.apply` (no restart registry — initial fixture apply should NOT synthesize `cc --resume`, because the plan declares `claude.session_id` but `command` would normally be missing → we seed the fixture with an explicit `command: "echo seed"` on the terminals so the initial apply path is deterministic).
2. Capture the live workspace via `LiveWorkspaceSnapshotSource.capture(workspaceId:)` → `WorkspaceSnapshotFile`.
3. Write through `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.write(_:to:)` to a temp directory; read back via `WorkspaceSnapshotStore.read(from:)`; assert the round-tripped envelope is `Equatable`-equal to the captured one (strips only the `created_at` + `snapshot_id` when comparing).
4. Run `WorkspaceSnapshotConverter.applyPlan(from:)` on the read-back envelope; get a `WorkspaceApplyPlan`.
5. Strip the `command` fields from the plan's terminal surfaces (simulating the "no explicit command, let restart registry decide" case), then `WorkspaceLayoutExecutor.apply` with `ApplyOptions(restartRegistry: .phase1)`.
6. Assertions:
   - `ApplyResult.failures` contains no `restart_registry_declined` entries (both terminals had session ids).
   - Both terminals received the correct `cc --resume <session-id>` text (observable via the same test-harness read path Phase 0's acceptance fixture uses — either inspect `TerminalPanel.pendingSendText` or route through the existing buffer-read helper in `WorkspaceLayoutExecutorAcceptanceTests.swift`).
   - `mailbox.*` pane-metadata keys round-trip byte-for-byte: read back via `PaneMetadataStore.shared.getMetadata(workspaceId:paneId:)`, compare maps directly.
   - Surface `title` values byte-exact; surface-name addressing is unchanged across the round-trip.
   - Layout tree structural fingerprint (orientation + pane grouping + tab order + `selectedIndex`) matches the fixture.
   - `ApplyResult.warnings` contains no unexpected entries.
7. Negative case (one additional test method): re-run step 5 with `ApplyOptions(restartRegistry: nil)` and assert both terminals receive **no** command (Phase 0-default behavior preserved when the gate is off).

**Invocation:** CI-only, triggered via `gh workflow run test-e2e.yml` with `test_filter=WorkspaceSnapshotRoundTripAcceptanceTests`. Never run locally per `CLAUDE.md` testing policy.

### Open questions for the operator

1. **List-snapshots columns.** Default columns proposed: `SNAPSHOT_ID`, `CREATED_AT`, `WORKSPACE_TITLE`, `SURFACES`, `ORIGIN`, `SOURCE`. Drop any? Add any? The minimum useful set is probably `SNAPSHOT_ID`, `CREATED_AT`, `WORKSPACE_TITLE`, `SURFACES`. Happy to default-trim if preferred; not worth blocking Impl on.
2. **`c11 snapshot` default argument.** Proposed: no args = current workspace, `--workspace <ref>` targets another. An explicit `--all` goes out to Phase 3 per plan scope. Is `c11 snapshot` (no args) the right default, or should it require `--workspace` always? Impl default assumes "no args = current" unless told otherwise.

### Stop line

Phase 1 ships `c11 snapshot` / `c11 restore` / `c11 list-snapshots` + Claude session resume (cc-only) + the session-id metadata-write augment to the `claude-hook session-start` handler + the `skills/c11/references/claude-resume.md` doc. Blueprints, the new-workspace picker, `c11 snapshot --all`, codex/opencode/kimi restart-registry rows, browser-history / markdown-scrollback persistence beyond what the snapshot file already carries — all remain out of scope for Phase 1 and land in Phases 2–5 per the master plan.
